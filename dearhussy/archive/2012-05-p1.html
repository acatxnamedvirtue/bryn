<p>I know, boring dream posts are boring, but last night I had an orgasm in my sleep. This happens to me every week, or maybe every other week. People seem to think that&rsquo;s really weird, but it&rsquo;s been happening to me most of my adult life. Also, I was dreaming I was having sex with this guy I only know via Facebook, and have never even met in real life. #creeper</p>
<p>In other news, I have this mild obsession with checking out like the trashiest of baby dykes on Fetlife. A 24 y/o Jewish Republican cheesy bodybuilder butch with extreme race fetishes who is probably also a racist! A 22 y/o with shaped eyebrows and Guido bling who posts pics of herself wearing a strap-on covered in her partner&rsquo;s menstrual blood (groups lead: Lavayan Satanists)! #creeper2themax</p>
<p>The wonders of the internet.</p>

<p>Once I read this really interesting study about how teenagers used Facebook, wherein the investigators interviewed like 1,500 teenagers in the US and Canada about their patterns of digital interaction, the language they use around that stuff, and their feelings about all of it. This is in the wake especially of the national conversation around teen &ldquo;bullying,&rdquo; cyber and otherwise.</p>
<p>What they found is that teenagers generally do not use the language of &ldquo;bullying,&rdquo; except to describe a very specific set of acts, usually a very extreme and egregious example of one kid (usually male) with outsider social difficulties repeatedly enacting direct violence toward another kid (usually male) with greater outsider social difficulties. The word they used the vast majority of the time to talk about a whole complicated, diffuse network of aggressions and counter-aggressions &ndash; some of which were obviously behavior most adults would consider bullying but many of which were not &ndash; was &ldquo;drama.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the investigators set out to attempt to quantify and qualify this question: what is &ldquo;drama?&rdquo; What do teenagers mean when they talk about &ldquo;drama&rdquo;? Who creates &ldquo;drama&rdquo;? What does the process of doing &ldquo;drama&rdquo; look like? Who suffers from &ldquo;drama,&rdquo; and who benefits from it? What function does it serve?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I remember of the outcome:</p>
<p>1) Boys hate drama like vampires hate garlic. Except if vampires also grew garlic and came by to water it every now and then. Which is to say, boys claim to greatly dislike drama and seek to avoid girls they perceive as participating in drama, though they are more often than not an instigating factor in drama and occasionally pop in to fan the flames. They tend to prefer &ldquo;punking&rdquo; (each other), but that is a whole other story.</p>
<p>2) When asked to describe the major function and quality of drama in a sentence, the authors of the study defined it thusly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Drama is, in essence, feminized emotional work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;d say that&rsquo;s about right.</p>

<p>i am currently experimenting with wearing a strong lip. specifically, i have been wearing MAC&rsquo;s <em>lady danger </em>lip color, which is like an orange-ish red, which some people interpret as straight-up orange, which i attribute to natural variation in sensual perception. i mean, i know a couple people who are color-blind, so so what.</p>
<p>i totally ganked this lip color suggestion from mx. justin bond&rsquo;s elegant <a href="http://www.feministpress.org/books/justin-vivian-bond/tango">slimoire</a>, and i say, you know, what maybe works, works. i have shied away from intense reds in the past because most of them are blue-based, which is like, ugh, no. but i&rsquo;m into this one, and it&rsquo;s matte and hardcore.</p>
<p>WHICH I AM TELLING YOU BECAUSE it&rsquo;s kind of a thing, a solidarity, to see another lady on the bus at 9am who is wearing astrong lip, it&rsquo;s like, you go girl. it&rsquo;s nine am and you&rsquo;re not afraid to put it down on me (and everybody else.) (with your lips.)</p>
<p>in other news you did not need or really care to know, i have really fucked up toenails. like, everyone says their feet are weird, but mine are really weird. and, stubbornly, i continue to wear sandals and, nay,<em> flip. flops</em>. because, i mean, they are the best. and whenever i see a girl on public transportation with fucked up feet, i&rsquo;m like, solidarity, girl.</p>
<p>so, this has been a vacuous post about femme clichés. i am one of those girls. but, whatever, it&rsquo;s fun, and it has been fun to bore you with my personal grooming minutiae for like three minutes.  </p>

<p>remember when we fucked on the beach last summer? the thing about fucking on the beach, or, for that matter, writing about fucking on the beach is that they&rsquo;re both really cheesy things to do.</p>
<p>the hard part about writing, or, for that matter, reading &ldquo;erotica&rdquo; is that affect defies language and cannot really be transferred. which is to say, when i got fucked on the beach that one time, i experienced all of these pre-verbal bodily intensities and whatnot, and they were like really really intense, but there&rsquo;s really no way for me to tell you about it so you will feel exactly like i felt. i mean, i guess that&rsquo;s the challenge, but for real, i could tell you about it, but you would be like, so you got fucked on the beach, so what.</p>
<p>and fucking on the beach, in particular, is laden with so much bodice-ripping waxed-chest romance novel crap that there&rsquo;s not even much that can be said about it. i mean i could tell you that i felt like i melted away from my body and turned into a breathing, expansive mareograph and i forgot where i ended and the rest of the universe began and i felt at one with &ldquo;nature,&rdquo; like &ldquo;nature&rdquo; was no longer that thing that was going on outside that i try to insulate myself from but a thing that i was a part of, that was inside me, that was all around me, that was me &ndash; or whatever, that might not mean much either.</p>
<p>but suffice to say that it was very cool. i wondered what you thought when those random guys were watching us, circling around us not like sharks but like, i don&rsquo;t know, pidgeons at the park when you sit down to eat a muffin, like how do they even know you&rsquo;re eating a muffin, but there they are, wanting you to throw them a piece. these guys did not exactly want us to throw them a piece, but maybe they thought if they got close enough we might be like, hey, wanna join in. which is weird, too, in a way, because like we&rsquo;re on the gay beach, so what do they even want with straight (&ldquo;straight,&rdquo; whatever) people fucking.</p>
<p>i have a guess that they were like, the kind of dudes who hung on at ten pm at the gay beach not because they identified in power-is-an-incitement-to-discourse kind of political category of &ldquo;gay,&rdquo; but because they were the kind of dudes who wanted to get their rocks off and like the ocean, and liked drinking 40s. and they were cheering us on, silently, and occasionally not so silently.</p>
<p>and i wondered how it was like for you, suddenly finding yourself in the sexual hunting grounds of men, participating in it, putting on a show. being a stud. fucking a girl on a blanket surrounded by empty bottles of cheap champagne (i know, i know, when we go for bodice-ripping we go for bodice-ripping.) while other guys are envious of you. or maybe they&rsquo;re envious of me for getting fucked by you. or maybe they&rsquo;re both. or maybe they&rsquo;re just bored and we are something happening on a tuesday night. it is almost september.</p>
<p>the fog rolled in and cloaked us and surrounded us and we breathed it in and then it was us. and my hair got all crazy. and we took the bus home and took a shower together, which i hate, but we did it by candlelight, which wasn&rsquo;t so bad. and we slept the sleep of the dead, by which i mean the sleep of people who became ghost, shadows and mist, by the sea.</p>
