<h2>THE FOOT BEHIND THE PUMP: UNMASKING THE HUSSY</h2>
<p>So, here&rsquo;s the thing. Writer/scholar <a href="http://anderlawlor.tumblr.com">Andrea Lawlor</a> was kind enough to interview me about my &ldquo;process,&rdquo; which I think this provides is a good opportunity to exeunt this project before it dies a slow, painful, irrelevant death. I mean, in many ways, this post is like the last episode of Seinfeld or whatever. </p>
<br/><p><i>AL: How do you think your work differs from others in its genre?</i></p>

<p>The Hussy is a persona piece: I, the author, am not the Hussy, but the Hussy is an extension of me. It is a larger-than-life-sized version of myself. And yet, the line is very thin; the membrane is permeable. </p>

<p>In what has been loosely termed &ldquo;queer community,&rdquo; there are a number of writers, poets and artists who make &ldquo;femme work&rdquo; of some kind. I had noticed a trend over the last ten years or so, that these works seem to all have some kind of Oprah-esque neoliberal creation-of-the-self-through-personal-empowerment bent. They are about healing from trauma or self-affirmation or fighting &ldquo;femmephobia&rdquo; or what have you. Some of these works are better than others. Some of them are very unfortunate. </p>

<p>I wanted to take a different tack. I wanted to deploy &ldquo;femme&rdquo; as it has historically been used &ndash; as an outlaw sexual identity &ndash; and investigate it with a contemporary lens. </p>

<p><b>I do not want &ldquo;femme empowerment.&rdquo; I want femmes at our worst. At our ugliest, most selfish, most narcissistic, most histrionic, most competitive, most needy.</b> I want to explore the &ldquo;negative&rdquo; affective realm of whatever the hell it is we&rsquo;re calling &ldquo;femme&rdquo; these days. To me, this is work about the grittiness of a feminine emotional and intimate life. </p>

<p>Also, the thought occurred to me, Why do boys get to have all the fun? People rarely complain about the endless misogyny from authors like T Cooper (who is very talented) and Sinclaire Sexsmith (in my opinion, much less so.) I set out to even the score. If men (boizzz) (masculine-of-center-theys) (whatever) can be &ldquo;bad,&rdquo; why can&rsquo;t women? </p>

<p>Oh, and by the by, the pseudonymity of the blog gave me the freedom to explore these feelings without being shunned by, like, everyone. When <a href="http://leger.tumblr.com">Tom</a> proposed I start this project, I came to him with my first couple of pieces, and a tremendous amount of ambivalence about whether or not to publish them. &ldquo;Seriously though. We can&rsquo;t ever let <i>anyone</i> know my true identity, or <i>I will never get laid again</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In fact, quite the opposite happened. When you really write with unflinching honesty, especially about your personal life, it&rsquo;s like sending a flare up into the sky &ndash; someone out there is going to see it, and want to check it out and know more. My current boyfriend was probably The Hussy&rsquo;s biggest fan, and had to pull some pretty intrepid maneuvers to track me down. We&rsquo;ve been together for over a year now. (Again, bizarrely, <a href="http://www.oprah.com/relationships/Falling-in-Love-with-a-Transgender-Man">something not at all unlike this</a> happened to T Cooper, too.)</p>

<p>Point of the story is, if you want something, write about it. Get on a stage and sing about it. Write a play and force other people to act it out. Don&rsquo;t hold back. Just put it out there. Desire responds to desire. </p>

<p><i>AL: Why do you write what you do?</i></p>

<p>My work is meant to be read by a microcommunity within a microcommunity. An editor I had for a story in proper *actual art journal* gave me some feedback recently, &ldquo;You do a good job of capturing, like, what we understand to be THE TRANS MAN NOW.&rdquo; Which is hilarious, because the character I was writing was in no way any kind of Chaz Bono. I am speaking to a few select readers, mostly in North American cosmopolitan areas who have assembled enough of a critical mass of queers around them to get the jokes. </p>

<p>And here&rsquo;s the thing about those jokes: when I wrote for Pretty Queer, many people speculated as to what I was trying to &ldquo;do&rdquo; with the Hussy: they said, oh, it&rsquo;s irony, it&rsquo;s satire, it&rsquo;s hyperbole.</p>

<p>Some commenters thought it was transphobic garbage. One unforgettable comment I got was, &ldquo;I need to go scrub my eyeballs with Comet after reading this article.&rdquo; THESE COMMENTERS WERE RIGHT ON THE MONEY. </p>

<p><b>Because the joke of the Hussy is, it&rsquo;s not a joke.</b> Everything I wrote/write was/is 100% serious, even if it was insulting or vicious or took cheap shots or exposed an emotional situation with all its terrible ugly warts and seeping oozing abscesses. </p>

<p>When Tom proposed I do this column, his only instructions were, &ldquo;tell the truth.&rdquo; So that&rsquo;s what I sought out to do, as best as I could. And any close reader of the work has to admit, the biggest monster in any work by The Hussy is The Hussy herself. </p>

<p><i>AL: What are you working on right now?</i></p>

<p>Actually, quite a lot. My writing education has been mostly in drama, and I am returning to my roots in theater, by starting a company to produce under-produced works that are actually, like, relevant, though it has been slow going, as theater is always a slog. I always have a million side writing projects going on at any given time &ndash; submit to THIS anthology, read a story at THIS reading, etc &ndash; and I&rsquo;m also an artist in other media, as well as running another small business in fashion. So, contrary to the stoned lazy layabout pillow queen I play on this blog, I&rsquo;m actually quite industrious. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad that boring question is out of the way. </p>

<p><i>AL: How does your writing process work?</i></p>

<p>It is mostly impulsive/compulsive. </p>

<p>The Hussy is series of works of creative non-fiction, observational quips, visual media, and, like I said before, a lot of intra-community jokes. It is highly intergenre work, which I think is most of what you will find on Tumblr, which I think makes it an exciting medium for young artists. (Both the Hussy, and the author, are not young artists. The puzzles intergenerationality are a big jumping-off point for the work.)</p>

<p>In the the documentary that accompanies Silas Howard&rsquo;s music video, <a href="http://youtu.be/fwr0pFho32E">THE GOLDEN AGE OF HUSTLERS</a> (starring Justin Vivian Bond), Silas asks legendary San Francisco chanteuse Bambi Lake why she started writing songs. (Bambi, coincidentally, started writing at about the same age that I am now.) She says, <i>I read somewhere that Joni Mitchell pretty much only wrote songs about her ex boyfriends. So I thought, what the hell, if it worked for her, maybe I&rsquo;ll give it a go. </i></p>

<p>In a clip that ended up on the cutting room floor, they ask her about her current husband. She said, <i>Oh, I&rsquo;m never without a husband. A woman with a man? That&rsquo;s a <b>narrative</b>. A woman without a man? That&rsquo;s a <b>tragedy</b>.</i></p>

<p>I mean, chew on <i>that</i> for a while. </p>

<p>For numerous reasons, it feels like it&rsquo;s almost time to draw the curtain on this Hussy project, for reasons I will further elucidate on in an upcoming post, but suffice to say, it&rsquo;s just gotten boring and sort of run its course. BUT BEFORE SHE HITS THE ROAD, the Hussy would like to give out a few superlative masculinities awards:</p>

<p>Most Generic Trans Dude Tumblr Whose Name Still Makes Me Laugh Every Time It Pops Up in My Dash: <a href="http://theotheropinion.tumblr.com/post/43694496536/tsunamiofswag-10-months-on-t-and-2-days-away">tsunamiofswag</a><br/>
- no tsunamis, very little swag, but put them together and&hellip;</p>

<p>The Mark Beyer Award for Best Comix About Existential Alienation: <a href="http://othermike.tumblr.com">othermike</a><br/>

<p>Best Boyfriend, Who Is My Boyfriend: <a href="http://highmasc.tumblr.com">highmasc</a><br/>
- fact: at first glance, tumblr seems kind of like livejournal and twitter had an abortion together, but then you hit the back of the wardrobe and boom it is a land of enchantment like Narnia, filled with fascinating people and creatures. to mix my metaphors here, g has been the Hussy&rsquo;s white rabbit through this misadventure. thanks for continuing to put up with my shit. you are a trooper.</p>
