<h2>ASCENSION </h2>
<p>the Hussy is in the PNW, staying in the house of a hot daddy nerd who is her friend of many years&rsquo; new huzbutch</p>
<p>this is a classic set-up for Hussy antics but AHEM trying to turn over a new leaf here, change my evil ways</p>
<p>personal growth is bad for literary blogging drama, good 4 lifestyles </p>

<p><strong>Some semiotechnical codes of white heterosexual femininity belonging to the postwar pharmacopornographic political ecology:</strong></p>
<p><em>Little Women, </em>a mother&rsquo;s courage, the Pill, the hyperloaded cocktail of estrogens and progesterone, the honor of virgins, <em>Sleeping Beauty, </em>bulemia, the desire for a child, the shame of deflowering, <em>The Little Mermaid,</em> silence in the face of rape, <em>Cinderella, </em>the ultimate immorality of abortion, cakes and cookies, knowing how to give a good blowjob, bromazepam, the shame about not having done it yet, <em>Gone with the Wind, </em>saying no when you want to say yes, not leaving home, having small hands, Audrey Hepburn&rsquo;s ballet shoes, codeine, taking care of your hair, fashion, saying yes when you want to say no, anorexia, knowing in secret that the one you&rsquo;re really attracted to is your best friend, fear of growing old, the need to be on a diet constantly, the beauty imperative, kleptomania, compassion, cooking, the desperate sensuality of Marylin Monroe, the manicure, not making any noise when you walk, not making any noise when you eat, not making any noise, the immaculate and carcinogenic cotton of Tampax, the certainty that maternity is a natural bond, not knowing how to cry, not knowing how to fight, not knowing how to kill, not knowing much or knowing a lot but not being able to say it, knowing how to wait, the subdued elegance of Lady Di, Prozac, fear of being a bitch in heat, Valium, the necessity of the G-string, knowing how to restrain yourself, letting yourself be fucked in the ass when it&rsquo;s necessary, being resigned, accurate waxing of the pubes, depression, thirst, little lavender balls that smell good, the smile, the living mummification of the smooth face of youth, love before sex, breast cancer, being left by your husband for a younger woman&hellip;</p>

<h2>MALVERSATION</h2>
<p>this morning the Hussy was asked to be on a panel that grants an award in lesbian literature </p>
<p>which is hilarious for many reasons, not the least of which is that it is #true that one of her favorite past-times is judging lesbians </p>

<blockquote><p>ummmmm pack’n’play dicks r gr8 but it’s hard to fully take advantage of the possible spontaneity b/c of how there’s dang lil FUZZies all over it when it comes out of my pants. who wants to give a fuzzy blowjob??? no one. i gotta pause and go rinse. i mean, small problems, but problems none the less.</p>
<p>i only come back to tumblr for really important reasons.<br/></p>

hmmm it sounds like what you need is a thing that keeps things from interfering with other things, aka a *prophylaxis.* it’s too bad they don’t make dick-shaped prophylactics! oh wait, they do. stick an unlubricated condom on that thing b4 u zip up and pull it off rill quick when it’s time for beej. </p>
<p>but, there’s a larger issue at play here which is, bjs are hottest when the beej giver is so hungry for the cock that lintz or fuzzes nor hell nor high water nor rain or snow or dark of night can keep that fellater from their appointed rounds (hence the perennial - not to mention perianal - popularity of xtube ATM). </p>
<p>like when you’re in midtown and you only have $5 and you skipped breakfast and you only have 15 minutes between gigs, you will eat that hotdog from a cart no matter what kind of toilet water it’s been cooking in. but enough with the gross metaphors, what the Hussy is saying here is, find a slut who is basically totally starved for cock ok</p>

<p>tonight i was on some kink forum where someone was writing about their feelings of depression, about not leaving their bed for months, about missing out on life, about not having any friends. i felt bad for them but my eyes kind of glazed over bc, let’s face it, everyone is completely miserable. it was probably about a 500-word rant that ended with, </p>
<p>&ldquo;…and I have PAID for moves in Candy Crush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>and then i was like, whoa</p>
<p>this is serious </p>

<h2>hii, I found that paola revenioti article on fb via you, would love to credit you/your tumblr for linking it but wasn't sure about privacy concerns??? I can tag you if you like!</h2>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if it was actually me! i don&rsquo;t think i posted anything about that on facebook. though <a href="http://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/16110/1/paola-revenioti">paola revenioti</a> is like truly madly deeply a hussy after the Hussy&rsquo;s own heart. </p>
<p>i thought about this q a lot actually. i mean idk if the Hussy is the best to comment on this but i feel paola&rsquo;s work &ndash; this is true generous narcissism. a way of recording the self, the moment, the rhizome, through a deep, sexy, loving, admiring gaze at the other; or even, the many loved and desired others. it is loving the self through a deep seeing of the beloved. idk i m no art critique tho.</p>

<h2>Dear Hussy,  which is more egregious in terms of being "totally fucking awkward": referring to ID-Glide single serving lube packets as "awesome, like ketchup, ketchup that you fuck with" or bringing up Sandra Lee, queen of "semi-homemade" food and vodka based cocktails to poison your friends with, during coitus?  Sincerely yours and all thats, SG P.S. how much would you, theoretically, charge for a no limits bang sesh with Guy Fierri?</h2>
<p>the Hussy personally does not see any thing at all wrong with bringing up the First Lady of the Empire State whilst kickin it</p>
<p>the Sandra Lee media brand is all about how she pulled herself out of poverty and squalor with her 500-things-you-can-do-with-pie-filling tricksies, and now that bitch is living in the governor&rsquo;s mansion while NOT married to Andrew Cuomo (a top serious gravitational masc) and sending out instagram holiday cards, this is a v v Hussy-esque move, do approve</p>
<p>the other thing is like the worst kind of lena dunham poor imitator awkward, go back to oberlin ohio and work at the coop for a while longer and germinate and try again, geez, yuck</p>
<p>as for guy fieri ya sure the Hussy would cut his cruncy bangs though she probably would not like it and charge him double (which is actually only $30 since bang trims are $15)</p>
