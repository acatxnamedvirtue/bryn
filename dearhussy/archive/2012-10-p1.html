<p>Protofeminist and <em>A Vindication of the Rights of Women</em> author <strong>Mary Wollstonecraft</strong> in a (failed) suicide note to American adventurer Gilbert Imlay, 1795:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;God bless you! May you never know by experience what you have made me endure. Should your sensibility ever awake, remorse will find its way to your heart; and, in the midst of business and sensual pleasure, I shall appear before you, the victim of your deviation from rectitude.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>AND EVERY TIME I SCRATCH MY NAILS<br/>DOWN SOMEONE ELSE&rsquo;S BACK<br/>I HOPE YOU FEEL IT<br/><br/>WELL CAN YOU FEEL IT</p>

<p>I had this dream last night that because of some weird rent-paying scheme machinations, my roommates announced that they had invited my ex to live with us. They announced it at a big house meeting and he was there.</p>
<p>I confronted him and screamed at him. &ldquo;What is wrong with you? What the fuck are you thinking??&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said, &ldquo;I knew you would throw a fit. I actually made a pro and con list, to help me decide whether or not to take this step. Look at my biggest &lsquo;con&rsquo;: <em>She will be cruël to me.</em> And here, 'she&rsquo; means you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he actually showed me the list, and on the list, he had written it just like that. &ldquo;Cruël.&rdquo; With an umlaut, like they do in <em>The New Yorker</em>. Except they do not write it like &ldquo;cruël&rdquo; in <em>The New Yorker</em>, because the umlaut denotes an extra syllable where you might think there wouldn&rsquo;t be one, and only total tools pronounce &ldquo;cruel&rdquo; with two syllables. </p>
<p>The moral of the story is, don&rsquo;t ever ever ever date poets.</p>
