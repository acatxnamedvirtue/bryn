<p>I&rsquo;m on this kick of reading my old journals lately.</p>

<p>2/20/09 8:19pm</p>
<p>It is Oscar season, and I&rsquo;m watching a lot of movies. Guess what? That&rsquo;s right, they all make me think of you. I always empathize so strongly with movie characters. I&rsquo;m always looking for myself and my lover in an on-screen couple, so of course, you and I are in every leading role. </p>
<p><strong>Of course</strong>, I&rsquo;m Kate Winslet and you are that boy in The Reader. I often feel like a cold, illiterate bitch and you are the smart, precocious boy who grows up to be a lawyer and I teach you all about sex and you teach me all about books but I&rsquo;m always distant and cold and am eventually revealed to be a monster but you can&rsquo;t stop loving me even though I just sort of keep getting worse and worse and keep needing you. (&ldquo;Precocious,&rdquo; by the way, is a word that does not have a negative connotation, though you always used to use it like that, which got on my nerves. It means &ldquo;to display an aptitude for something at an early age,&rdquo; and is generally considered a compliment, although you always used to use it to mean smart-alek-y or bratty.) Anyway. There are obvious parallels between that film and Notes on a Scandal, which, as I&rsquo;m sure you recall, spawned many an afternoon&rsquo;s role-play between. You used to call me up in that dopey Scottish accent and go, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking about your wet pussy all day,&rdquo; and I basically had to stop whatever I was doing to masturbate until I fell over. </p>
<p><strong>Of course</strong>, I am Penelope Cruz and you are that guy inVickie Christina Barcelona. I know you would probably hate to compared to that guy because he is &ldquo;slick&rdquo; and kind of sleazy, but you know you wish you were that guy, kind of. Anyway, I always love it when Woody writes about love &ndash; he&rsquo;s really at his best when he&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;So what&rsquo;s this deal with this whole &lsquo;love&rsquo; thing, anyway?&rdquo; When the male lead and Penelope talk about their relationship as a great love, a great passion, this all-consuming thing that is missing some small ingredient and how that missing ingredient makes the relationship unlivable&hellip; That reminds me of you and me, too. And of course, she is crazy and self-destructive, and bitter and paranoid and gifted and has crazy hair, and is constantly accusing her lover of stealing all her good ideas. And she stabbed him and he threw a chair at her. Which, I think, probably would have happened had we stayed together much longer.</p>
<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>WHICH WAS IN FACT KIND OF PRESCIENT, because when we got back together that&rsquo;s more or less what happened. </p>

<p>I am so funny sometimes. I wrote this several months ago in my journal and just went back and read it:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel about quitting him like I imagine a lot of people feel about quitting smoking. I don&rsquo;t really like him, and he&rsquo;s gross, and he leaves a gross stink on me, and people judge me for having him in my mouth all the time, but at the end of the day, he is intermittently comforting and we have spent a lot of time together, and my body has grown accustom to having a fix of him on a regular basis, and removing that has left me generally irritable and depressed and bitchy.&rdquo;</p>
