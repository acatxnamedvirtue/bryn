<p>The thing about being in a new city, especially for something like Pride, is that everyone pretty much looks the same everywhere. And you keep seeing people that you think are other people, and then you have the feelings associated with the people whom you think they are, and then it turns out that the person that you have just seen is not the person you just thought you saw and were having feelings about, and the overall effect (and the attendant affects) is/are disorienting and uncanny. </p>
<p>But then you think, oh, well, these people, they are basically the equivalents of the people I know in my other city. Same haircuts on different people. And to make things even weirder, occasionally the people that you think you recognize <em>actually are </em>the people you thought they were, like, &ldquo;Oh, hey! What are you doing here in this town? Oh, you are travelling, too? Isn&rsquo;t it funny how mobile us queers are? So funny to see you in this strange place, when I just saw you in another strange-but-less-strange-to-me place just a few weeks ago. This party, it is crazy, but not-as-crazy/slightly-more-crazy than the equivalent party we have back &quot;home&rdquo; (which of course is only sort of our home, because neither are these cities of which we speak are where we are &ldquo;from,&rdquo; if we are in fact &ldquo;from&rdquo; anywhere.)</p>
<p>Just one brief instance: you, beleaguered transmasculine cutie, you have the look of another henpecked transmasculine cutie I once knew, constantly checking your phone with a grimace, dealing with the onslaught of femmes and shims and daddies and others who want your time and attention and affection. And you have this look about you that is maybe a bit too friendly for your own good, the look that says you can fairly easily be bullied into receiving that text onslaught, that you will deal with while trying to enjoy yourself at a cook-out, that you will be lead around by the nose by some pushy femme at a dance party, that you will go on too many OKCupid dates because people seem to really really want to get to know you and then you will resent all of it because it is eating up the time that you would rather give to yourself to write the poetry you are too scared to write anyway. &hellip;I mean, that&rsquo;s just one example. </p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Everyone bleeds together.<br/>Our wounds aren&rsquo;t as invisible as we think they are. <br/>Everyone bleeds together. </p>
