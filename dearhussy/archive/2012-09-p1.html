<p>Okay so people always say the two major classifications of trans mans names tend go to like:</p>
<p>1) Variations on Aiden: Aden, Ayden, Aidyn, Hayden, Braden, Jaden, Graydon, Kayden, and yes, even once I met a Shayden (which up until that point was the moniker some friends of mine were using to apply to trans guys who lacked a certain degree of personal integrity: shady + Aiden, but then we couldn&rsquo;t really use it anymore, because people got confused, like, &ldquo;oh, you mean Shayden? I think he&rsquo;s a nice guy&hellip;&rdquo; </p>
<p>2) Old man names from the Bible: any of the many variations on Zachary &amp; Ezekiel, (Zach, Zack, Zeke), Abner, Abraham/Abram, Asher, Amos, Bartholomew, Caleb (OH ALL THE CALEBS, WHYY), Cyrus, Eli (SOO MANY WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE SHEEP), Ephraim, Ezra, Gabriel, Hiram, Isaiah, Japeth, Jedidiah, Jeremiah, Joel, Jonah, Levi (IF EVERYBODY ELSE WAS JUMPING OFF A BRIDGE WOULD YOU), Micah, Mordecai, Nehemiah, Philip, Raphael, Saul, Shiloh, Silas, Thaddeus, Tobiah/Tobias, Uriel, Zebadiah, Zedekiah &hellip;as well as more run-of-the-mill Bible names, like Matt, Mark, Luke, David, Aaron, Daniel, Jared, Jordan (DO THEY MAKE YOU IN FACTORIES, MY GOD), Joseph, Timothy, Noah, Seth, Michael, Simon, Peter, Ethan, Sam, Nathan, Thomas, Jesse, Andrew, (see also: Drew/Dru) and, of course, the surprisingly infrequent Adam. No Johns, though, curiously, unless we&rsquo;re talking about Jonathons (and hence, &ldquo;Jon,&rdquo; an infinitely inferior name.)</p>
<p>Now, show me a Gomer or a Habbukuk, and I tell you, we&rsquo;ll be in business.</p>
<p>But 3) it has recently come to my attention (though this may be old news) that there is a great way to describe another group of names that I was uncertain how to qualify, and that is, those names which refer to medieval professionals, hence: Brewer, Tailor (see also: Taylor, Tay), Hunter, Archer, Miller, Dean, Bard, Ward, Bishop, Weaver, Forrester, Tinker, Fletcher, Sawyer, Tanner, Harper, Mason, and omg COOPER. Fortunately, I have known no one with the bad taste to name himself Chandler, hence being saddled forever with the shadow personality of that famous 90s TV smart ass. <br/><br/>Okay so since I have basically listed every name for every man born in the last 50 years, I will shut up now. </p>
