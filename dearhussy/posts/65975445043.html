<h2>hii, I found that paola revenioti article on fb via you, would love to credit you/your tumblr for linking it but wasn't sure about privacy concerns??? I can tag you if you like!</h2>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if it was actually me! i don&rsquo;t think i posted anything about that on facebook. though <a href="http://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/16110/1/paola-revenioti">paola revenioti</a> is like truly madly deeply a hussy after the Hussy&rsquo;s own heart. </p>
<p>i thought about this q a lot actually. i mean idk if the Hussy is the best to comment on this but i feel paola&rsquo;s work &ndash; this is true generous narcissism. a way of recording the self, the moment, the rhizome, through a deep, sexy, loving, admiring gaze at the other; or even, the many loved and desired others. it is loving the self through a deep seeing of the beloved. idk i m no art critique tho.</p>
