<p>i am currently experimenting with wearing a strong lip. specifically, i have been wearing MAC&rsquo;s <em>lady danger </em>lip color, which is like an orange-ish red, which some people interpret as straight-up orange, which i attribute to natural variation in sensual perception. i mean, i know a couple people who are color-blind, so so what.</p>
<p>i totally ganked this lip color suggestion from mx. justin bond&rsquo;s elegant <a href="http://www.feministpress.org/books/justin-vivian-bond/tango">slimoire</a>, and i say, you know, what maybe works, works. i have shied away from intense reds in the past because most of them are blue-based, which is like, ugh, no. but i&rsquo;m into this one, and it&rsquo;s matte and hardcore.</p>
<p>WHICH I AM TELLING YOU BECAUSE it&rsquo;s kind of a thing, a solidarity, to see another lady on the bus at 9am who is wearing astrong lip, it&rsquo;s like, you go girl. it&rsquo;s nine am and you&rsquo;re not afraid to put it down on me (and everybody else.) (with your lips.)</p>
<p>in other news you did not need or really care to know, i have really fucked up toenails. like, everyone says their feet are weird, but mine are really weird. and, stubbornly, i continue to wear sandals and, nay,<em> flip. flops</em>. because, i mean, they are the best. and whenever i see a girl on public transportation with fucked up feet, i&rsquo;m like, solidarity, girl.</p>
<p>so, this has been a vacuous post about femme clichés. i am one of those girls. but, whatever, it&rsquo;s fun, and it has been fun to bore you with my personal grooming minutiae for like three minutes.  </p>
