<p>tonight i was on some kink forum where someone was writing about their feelings of depression, about not leaving their bed for months, about missing out on life, about not having any friends. i felt bad for them but my eyes kind of glazed over bc, let’s face it, everyone is completely miserable. it was probably about a 500-word rant that ended with, </p>
<p>&ldquo;…and I have PAID for moves in Candy Crush.&rdquo;</p>
