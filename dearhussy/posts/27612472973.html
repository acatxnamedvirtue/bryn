<p>I&rsquo;m on this kick of reading my old journals lately.</p>

<p>2/20/09 8:19pm</p>
<p>It is Oscar season, and I&rsquo;m watching a lot of movies. Guess what? That&rsquo;s right, they all make me think of you. I always empathize so strongly with movie characters. I&rsquo;m always looking for myself and my lover in an on-screen couple, so of course, you and I are in every leading role. </p>
<p><strong>Of course</strong>, I&rsquo;m Kate Winslet and you are that boy in The Reader. I often feel like a cold, illiterate bitch and you are the smart, precocious boy who grows up to be a lawyer and I teach you all about sex and you teach me all about books but I&rsquo;m always distant and cold and am eventually revealed to be a monster but you can&rsquo;t stop loving me even though I just sort of keep getting worse and worse and keep needing you. (&ldquo;Precocious,&rdquo; by the way, is a word that does not have a negative connotation, though you always used to use it like that, which got on my nerves. It means &ldquo;to display an aptitude for something at an early age,&rdquo; and is generally considered a compliment, although you always used to use it to mean smart-alek-y or bratty.) Anyway. There are obvious parallels between that film and Notes on a Scandal, which, as I&rsquo;m sure you recall, spawned many an afternoon&rsquo;s role-play between. You used to call me up in that dopey Scottish accent and go, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking about your wet pussy all day,&rdquo; and I basically had to stop whatever I was doing to masturbate until I fell over. </p>
<p><strong>Of course</strong>, I am Penelope Cruz and you are that guy inVickie Christina Barcelona. I know you would probably hate to compared to that guy because he is &ldquo;slick&rdquo; and kind of sleazy, but you know you wish you were that guy, kind of. Anyway, I always love it when Woody writes about love &ndash; he&rsquo;s really at his best when he&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;So what&rsquo;s this deal with this whole &lsquo;love&rsquo; thing, anyway?&rdquo; When the male lead and Penelope talk about their relationship as a great love, a great passion, this all-consuming thing that is missing some small ingredient and how that missing ingredient makes the relationship unlivable&hellip; That reminds me of you and me, too. And of course, she is crazy and self-destructive, and bitter and paranoid and gifted and has crazy hair, and is constantly accusing her lover of stealing all her good ideas. And she stabbed him and he threw a chair at her. Which, I think, probably would have happened had we stayed together much longer.</p>
<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>WHICH WAS IN FACT KIND OF PRESCIENT, because when we got back together that&rsquo;s more or less what happened. </p>
