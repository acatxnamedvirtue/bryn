<h2>Dear The Hussy, I'm a young and casual sex loving trans guy who probably would fit quite neatly with the set you've come to know and fuck. Here's my rub-  my mode of operation has previously included a "want to go back to my place" even when that place was hilariously not suitable. My housing will soon be even less suitable than ever before. Care to share strategy on how to start sleeping in other people's beds?</h2>

<p>this is the best day!!!</p>
<p>dear sir: normally i would be flip and post some kind of cryptic .gif koan buuut i actually have A THING OR TWO TO SAY, as this is a serious subject and given that i have slept on way too many cat-hair covered yoga mats, bare pokey twin mattresses, and wolf blankets on the floor and would MUCH PREFER to have people over than go to fuck in some sad squirrel hole. perhaps these three tips will suffice:</p>
<p>1) NO BIKES. like, none. no bikes in the equation, anywhere. which is to say, do not ride your bike to things where there is even a REMOTE possibility you might be sexxxing after. because there is nothing worse than getting all hot for someone and making out with them and then figuring out the logistics of getting two people + bikes to someplace you might wanna fuck when it’s time to bounce. walk to wherever you’re going, or take the goddamn bus. bikes are a scourge on our community (like “awkwardness,” “processing,” and “tempeh”) so don’t make out with people who rode <em>their</em> bikes somewhere, either. they probably have bedbugs. <br/><br/>2) DON’T LOOK LIKE YOU HAVE BEDBUGS. you know what i mean. and if you do have bedbugs, lie about it.</p>
<p>3) OFFER TO PAY FOR DAT CAB. treat her like a lady. or treat him like a lady. regardless of gender, everybody who’s about to get fucked wants to be treated like a lady.</p>
<p>if you meet somebody and want to start sleeping in their bed on the reg, be attentive of their sleeping style and don’t crowd them if they’re trying to get some space and don’t steal the covers or thrash around and inquire about big spoon/little spoon preferences (also do some googling about big spoon techniques that do not make yr arm fall asleep, it will revolutionize your second-sleepover recidivist potential i promise) offer to go out and bring back food when you wake up especially if you’re hung over and also a good line is “wow, you look so beautiful/hot/glowy/whatever in the morning.” speaking for myself that goes a long way bc even though i know you are lying and i look like a crazy mess and have drooled all over myself and my eye goop is all black from last night’s aborted attempt at a “smokey eye” and my tracks are falling out, i enjoy maintaining that call-me-angel-of-morning fiction.</p>
<p>that said,</p>
