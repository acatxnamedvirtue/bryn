<h2>OkCupid user /transkayla- Read a bitch?</h2>
<p>The Hussy generally considers this kind of thing beneath her, but

</p><blockquote><p>I wish I liked heteronormative bi girls with terrible taste in boys and regressive attitudes about sex and relationships who are eager to lose themselves in another person as part of some weird codependent psychological script, because this city is fucking overflowing with them.</p>

<p>Not interested in people who have a man as a primary partner or who regularly date men (if you think trans men don’t count as men, then you’re a transmisogynist shitbag and I want nothing to do with you). I find romantic attraction to men to be rather icky and I find testosterone to be sexually repulsive.</p></blockquote>

…it seems that OKCupid user /transkayla has already preemptively read The Hussy pretty well herself.
