<h2><a href="http://.http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/features/n_9709/">WHERE THE BOIS ARE(N'T)</a></h2>
<p>A friend recently brought to my attention that this article still exists, and I have to say, eight years later, it is less apt to inspire rage and more so, hilarity.</p>

<p>Écoutez-vous lez dorkinesse:</p>

<p>•  liberal use of references to “the scene,” just like that, in scare quotes<br/>
• “She wears a baggy T-shirt and jeans and she has gelled her bleached hair into a stiff fin, like the raised spine of a Komodo dragon.”<br/>
• “Her whole aura was so rough-and-tumble 8-year old that I wouldn’t be surprised if she had a slingshot in one pocket and a frog in the other.”<br/>
• much talk of “riding” people, in a sexiness manner</p>

<p><br/>
And my absolute favorite:</p>

<p>“Boihood has nothing to do with earth mothers or sisterhood or herbal tea, and everything to do with being young, hip, ‘sex positive,’ a little masculine, and ready to rock.”</p>

<p><br/>
READY TO ROCK.</p>

<p>The other thing I noticed is that I know a lot of people, but I know almost no one like the people the article describes, though I WISH I DID.</p>

<p>• “Some of these chicks, it’s like you top them once and then they’re all up in your face. It’s like, did I get you off? Yes. Am I your new best friend? No. You know what I’m saying, bro?”<br/>
• “Guzzling beer and eating hot dogs and, like, football-watching guys—that’s what those women are, you know?… They feel like because they’re some big hunk of meat with abs, that’s all it takes.”<br/>
• “I hope she’s not a big deal, that you’re just riding her [again with the riding! -ed.] or whatever. Do you want me to keep an eye on her? Bros up bitches down.”<br/>
• “It was raining and I need to know what I’m getting if I’m going out in the rain for some chick and she better be slammin’. And anyway, I should be the one calling the shots.”<br/>
• “Her biggest fear when we started dating was that I was going to try and fuck her. She’s obsessed with operating sexually as a male… It also threatens her that I’m not totally vapid and vain. Her big relief was when she found out I wear a thong.”<br/>
• “I’ve got this model of a household that’s probably sick to a lot of people that makes perfect sense to me,” she says. “What I want is to have a job, and have a life, and I want a partner with a job and a life to come home to, and a high standard of living, and I want us to have kids that go to school and do their homework and go on trips with their parents.” She smiles for a minute with the self-satisfaction of an athlete about to cream his opponent. “And, you know, at the end of a hard day, I would like to come home from work and have my wife suck my cock.”</p>
