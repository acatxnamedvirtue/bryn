<h2>COUNTERPOINT</h2>
<p>hustled: Idk if its real or in my head. But I am tired of only having a sense that I am attractive bc people are always after me. Its a weird thing to complain about. I guess I just have bad boundaries and feel real sucked up and spit out<br>
hustled: I mean its real AND its in my head. It's like I get the vibe fr friends and lovers sometimes that ppl value me bc I'm supposedly such a "successful transsexual" bc I pass well and am cute or whatever. It sucks. Feels cheap<br>
hussy: let the record reflect i was trying to get into yr shorts when you were an autistic dyke<br>
hustled: let the record reflect that you are a hopeless slut</p>
