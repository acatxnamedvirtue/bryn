<h2>Huss, you go for Scandal? Rich morally ambiguous liberals + bonus gay republican. I can't believe I only got on board last week.</h2>
<p>well as you know (and as we have discussed) i am a huge fan of THE GOOD WIFE cuz rich liberals and courtroom drama but SCANDAL is pretty good too</p>
<p>i mean SCANDAL is one of the most written-about shows on television so there’s not much left to say except that Olivia Pope is kind of the ultimate Hussy, a HBIC with a penchant for making power-mascs fall in love with her (especially those of the emotionally-unavailable variety)</p>
<p>also the Hussy tunes in for SCANDAL every week for Mellie’s giant teased up bouffant, esp when combined with that crazy fall. #TrueSpirit2001TulsaOklahomaFemmeRealness</p>
<p><em>also speaking of the aforementioned</em> THE GOOD WIFE <em>and courtroom drama in general</em>, the Hussy would like to tell you (and her general readership) about a *disgusting* dream she had last night. she is loathe to even talk about it in the same breath as these excellent escapist tv shows, but here goes (TW: EVERYTHING IS HORRIBLE):</p>
<p>the Hussy was for some reason stuck at and bored at some terrrrrible play party in some godforsaken Other Town (philly maybe?) she saw unspeakable things, like certain femmelebrities getting their “femme cocks” sucked and assorted blechhhh</p>
<p>eventually this marginally cute soft butch/nondescript femme couple recruited the Hussy into some “scene” by telling her it was gonna be like, <em>courtroom drama play</em>. the Hussy would act as judge and accuser and verbally berate the butch for his supposed emotional “crimes” while the femme beat the shit out of him.</p>
<p>to which the Hussy replied, well, what are his issues? bc the Huss does NOT fuck around when it comes to rooting around for roots in the psychosexual root cellar. and the femme was like, well, he smokes, which is really bad, cuz his mom just died of lung cancer</p>
<p>so then the Hussy goes, so if I were to holler at him YOU NEED TO STOP SMOKING THOSE FUCKING CIGARETTES WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU’RE SUCKKING ON YOUR DEAD MOM’S TITTIE!? FUCKING ORAL FIXATION WHAAAH I MISS MY MOMMY BOO HOO HOO — then, like, would that be taking it too far?</p>
<p>and the femme was like no that’s perfect</p>
<p>then i woke up</p>
