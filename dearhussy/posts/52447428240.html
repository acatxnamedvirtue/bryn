<h2>EPISTOLARY</h2>
<p><em>Hello, </em>Hussy<em>! .. Alas I’m wondering what you have in your closet that you’d consider 70s hooker… My thought for you is realness (not sequin fantasy) I love your blonde hair maybe with some waves? (more 70s) but straight works too/ maybe more exaggerated make up for the camera.. and the picture of you in white! I imagine you as a white “virgin” (haha) in the dark alleys!!! I can always whip up a little white dress if you don’t have something slutty enough.. We have a small budget so anything you have helps!! Thank you!! Xo</em></p>
