<blockquote><p>ummmmm pack’n’play dicks r gr8 but it’s hard to fully take advantage of the possible spontaneity b/c of how there’s dang lil FUZZies all over it when it comes out of my pants. who wants to give a fuzzy blowjob??? no one. i gotta pause and go rinse. i mean, small problems, but problems none the less.</p>
<p>i only come back to tumblr for really important reasons.<br/></p>

hmmm it sounds like what you need is a thing that keeps things from interfering with other things, aka a *prophylaxis.* it’s too bad they don’t make dick-shaped prophylactics! oh wait, they do. stick an unlubricated condom on that thing b4 u zip up and pull it off rill quick when it’s time for beej. </p>
<p>but, there’s a larger issue at play here which is, bjs are hottest when the beej giver is so hungry for the cock that lintz or fuzzes nor hell nor high water nor rain or snow or dark of night can keep that fellater from their appointed rounds (hence the perennial - not to mention perianal - popularity of xtube ATM). </p>
<p>like when you’re in midtown and you only have $5 and you skipped breakfast and you only have 15 minutes between gigs, you will eat that hotdog from a cart no matter what kind of toilet water it’s been cooking in. but enough with the gross metaphors, what the Hussy is saying here is, find a slut who is basically totally starved for cock ok</p>
