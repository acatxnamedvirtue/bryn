<p>i keep internet spying on my cohort for this writing retreat i&rsquo;m going on this summer. so many of my contemporaries have blogs in which they write about writing, and so many of their opinions are so stupid about everything. </p>
<p>nobody cares what you think of the mfa system. nobody cares that you are a fan of the &ldquo;discipline&rdquo; of &ldquo;genre fiction&rdquo; over the &ldquo;laziness&rdquo; of &ldquo;literary fiction.&rdquo; nobody cares what you have to say about the value or nonvalue of writers&rsquo; conferences. nobody cares what you think of the viscerality of the second person. oh, get off the internet, you <em>hobbit</em>-loving, irony-hating, pretentious petit bourgeois fucks. </p>
<p>this just in: bitch bitches about bitches bitching</p>
