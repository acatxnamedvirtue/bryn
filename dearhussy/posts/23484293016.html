<p>Once I read this really interesting study about how teenagers used Facebook, wherein the investigators interviewed like 1,500 teenagers in the US and Canada about their patterns of digital interaction, the language they use around that stuff, and their feelings about all of it. This is in the wake especially of the national conversation around teen &ldquo;bullying,&rdquo; cyber and otherwise.</p>
<p>What they found is that teenagers generally do not use the language of &ldquo;bullying,&rdquo; except to describe a very specific set of acts, usually a very extreme and egregious example of one kid (usually male) with outsider social difficulties repeatedly enacting direct violence toward another kid (usually male) with greater outsider social difficulties. The word they used the vast majority of the time to talk about a whole complicated, diffuse network of aggressions and counter-aggressions &ndash; some of which were obviously behavior most adults would consider bullying but many of which were not &ndash; was &ldquo;drama.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the investigators set out to attempt to quantify and qualify this question: what is &ldquo;drama?&rdquo; What do teenagers mean when they talk about &ldquo;drama&rdquo;? Who creates &ldquo;drama&rdquo;? What does the process of doing &ldquo;drama&rdquo; look like? Who suffers from &ldquo;drama,&rdquo; and who benefits from it? What function does it serve?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I remember of the outcome:</p>
<p>1) Boys hate drama like vampires hate garlic. Except if vampires also grew garlic and came by to water it every now and then. Which is to say, boys claim to greatly dislike drama and seek to avoid girls they perceive as participating in drama, though they are more often than not an instigating factor in drama and occasionally pop in to fan the flames. They tend to prefer &ldquo;punking&rdquo; (each other), but that is a whole other story.</p>
<p>2) When asked to describe the major function and quality of drama in a sentence, the authors of the study defined it thusly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Drama is, in essence, feminized emotional work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;d say that&rsquo;s about right.</p>
