<h2>Does The Hussy have a preferred brand of long lasting waterproof lip colour? I'm sure The Hussy can think of reasons why a girl would want such a thing...</h2>
<p>long wear lip color is a lie, a cultural myth perpetrated on you by sinister forces, like volumizing shampoo, mineral foundation, and &ldquo;sexuality&rdquo;</p>
<p>most long wear products flake off and start to look like scabs and dry out your lips and make them all scaly. that is gross! why would you want scaly scabby lizard lips! just reapply, jesus! (besides, smearing is sexy)</p>
<p>though i mean if you want color that won’t like, immediately disappear on you just find a good pigment rich matte lip color that will hang around for a while. the boring classic femme cliche ones are of course russian red, ruby woo &amp; (if you can pull off intense corals) lady danger by MAC, but a good budget alternative is wet-n-wild’s megalast line, just be careful with the pinks, they can look chalky</p>
