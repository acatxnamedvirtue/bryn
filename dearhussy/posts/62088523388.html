<h2>which make/model of cock most delights the hussy when she unzips dem skinny jeans</h2>
<p>the hussy has a sentimental attachment to the VixSkin Tex</p>
<p>it is 5 1/4 inches which is totally normal-sized, mascs are always #trynna impress with the <em>bandit</em> or the <em>outlaw</em> and the Hussy is like psssh what are you trying to prove, i mean it really is the motion of the ocean</p>
<p>a tip to know: it comes in three colors and nobody should buy the vanilla because it is not people-colored even though they say it is. the pics on all the websites have had color adjustment; the vanilla d actually IRL just kind of looks like a corpse peen. also like consider that no matter how white a white boy one may be, d is usually darker than the rest of skin so thus even for the most wan of mascs caramel is probably the better choice </p>
