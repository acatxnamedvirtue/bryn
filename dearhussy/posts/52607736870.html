<h2>will the queer community ever get over astrology? Also, what's the hussy's sign?</h2>
<p>astrology is the language of cosmopolitanism &ndash; it says, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t know me, and we share no material kinship network, but let me tell you about myself without the presumption of intimacy&rdquo;</p>
<p>the hussy is an aquarius with a capricorn rising which means she is a utopian but a very SLICK looking one. also, her venus is in pisces (as previously noted, ultrafemininity) and her moon is in libra (which is a different kind of beauty, and which also rules marriage, which is why she easily gets wifed up real fast.) all of her daddy planets (mars, jupiter &amp; saturn) are in virgo AND in the 8th house, which is the SEXY house, hence her deeply retrograde fetish for the conservative<br/><br/>also her sun is the first house, which means: FAME</p>
