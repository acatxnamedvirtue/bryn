<h2>Which songs DO you suggest for karaoke seduction of Th Masc or, which ones are definite no-no</h2>
<p>this of course depends so much on your personal brand, but pick ones that hit the sweet spot of your own vocal and affective range, ones that have worked for the Hussy include:</p>
<p>edge of seventeen (good for aspiring cougs)<br/>hungry like the wolf (esp in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRGyPAgyquk">the style of courtney love</a>)<br/>purple rain (esp if you can pull off *~soulful~*)</p>
