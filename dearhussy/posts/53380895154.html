<h2>READING</h2>
<p>once i threw a fundraiser that involved trans man oil wrestling for some dumb queer art thing at this house called transy house, which is this long-standing trans women&rsquo;s housing collective where sylvia rivera &amp; marsha p johnson and other assorted saints of the queer hagiography had lived at one point or another. it is very famous and dean spade keeps bugging me to write about it and i keep ignoring his emails for no good reason.</p>
<p>it was still hanging on kind of by a thread, it seemed, under the direction of this older trans woman named chelsea, who was 1) a witch and 2) a lesbian and 3) a literal blood-drinking vampire. she was also obviously very good with tarot cards and assorted dark magicks.</p>
<p>at the end of the night, at about 5am, while sharing a j, chelsea says,</p>
<p><em>you and i, we are the same. those who we hunt are different: i hunt for girls, and you hunt for boys. but we&rsquo;re the same kind of creature. you are like me. you&rsquo;re a <strong>predator</strong>.</em></p>
<p>and the Hussy went</p>

<p>because she knew it was true.</p>
