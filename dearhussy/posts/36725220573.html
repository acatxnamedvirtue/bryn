<h2>ADAM GOPNIK</h2>
<p>is right about this:<br/><br/>&ldquo;<em>Desire is not subject to the language of judicious choice, or it would not be desire, with a language all its own.</em> <strong>The point of lust, not to put too fine a point on it, is that it lures us to do dumb stuff, and the fact that the dumb stuff gets done is continuing proof of its power.</strong>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&hellip;and is probably wrong about this:<br/>&ldquo;The truth is that the force which through not the so green fuse drives all our flowers, and much else besides &ndash; the force of wanting that can cause women of substance to send pestering e-mails, leaving distinguished generals caught in the middle &ndash; is the force of life.&rdquo; <br/><br/>And, not surprisingly, he&rsquo;s really sad about Philip Roth.</p>
