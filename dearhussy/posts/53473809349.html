<h2>SURVEILLANCE </h2>
<p>the Hussy was peeping the tumppplrr of a 15 y/o trans boy high school wrestler</p>
<p>and then she was like, wow, this is perhaps the most boring blog i have ever seen: batman, skateboards, outer space, selena gomez.</p>
<p>so boring it almost seems fake</p>
<p>and then she got to thinking, omg!! what is this is an old man who is pretending to be a teen ftm on the internet in order to lure in other teen ftms toward illicit relations! (a couple of posts are like &ldquo;hey broz i think dating another tranz dude my age might be kewl&rdquo;)</p>
<p>but then the Hussy was like, wait! what if this is a bait blog and it is meant to catch the creeps who might predate upon tiny teen ftms!!! que possible</p>
<p>and then she felt weird</p>
