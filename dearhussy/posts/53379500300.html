<h2>TYPE 2, SOCIAL: THE SCHEMING CHEERLEADER</h2>
<p><em>Social Twos feel loved by having an important place in the lives of their friends, family, and colleagues.They enjoy introducing people to one another and generally act as the &ldquo;social hub&rdquo; of whatever they are involved with. Social Twos tend to be outgoing and high-spirited, often resembling Sevens, and to get energy from their interactions with their friends. Indeed, Social Twos think of all of their colleagues and acquaintances as friends and their friends as family. They usually know the names of all of the local shopkeepers, the mailman, the waiters, and bartenders at their favorite restaurants and bars, and so forth.</em></p>
<p><span><em>Social Twos have a subtle &ldquo;radar&rdquo; for people in need of a sympathetic audience and may appear with a smile and some kind words. While the pride of the Two does not allow them to have social ambitions of success and fame for themselves, they often achieve these things indirectly by becoming &ldquo;the power behind the throne.&rdquo; Thus, they are able to rise socially by attaching themselves as advisors and primary supports to someone who is successful in some way.</em> </span></p>
