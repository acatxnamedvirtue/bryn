<h2><a href="http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/you-are-too-much/">You Are Too Much – The New Inquiry   </a></h2>
<p>The Overly Attached Girlfriend — in her more baldly expressed ambivalence, her blank affect, her death-grip on perceived promises — represents the struggling decline, hopefully terminal, of the straight couple as normative destiny. Monogamy is over, long-term job contracts are over, retirement is over, mortgages are over, cinema is over (kind of), novels are over (pretty much), content is compressed into a single fleeting moment: the meme. Everything you need to understand you need to understand immediately&hellip; Even (or perhaps most of all) in the gated community of middle-class white womanhood, women not only can’t have what they want, they are barred from frank expressions of wanting&hellip; Now, at least in most mainstream discourse, feels-shaming is more common than slut-shaming: the shame of being too much or too little, too warm or too cold, too ambivalent or too certain. </p>

<p>&hellip; </p>

<p>In her breakthrough video, she sings a parody of Justin Bieber’s “If I Was Your Boyfriend.” “If I was your girlfriend/I’d follow you everywhere.” The lyrics, only slightly contorted from the original, and, significantly, re-gendered, take the surreal intensity of Bieber’s offer and turn it into violence, the kind of muted, self-hating violence that Girlfriends are capable of. Laina’s video doesn’t really respond to Bieber’s song, because the two intensities could never meet in the middle. The convergence between the central text of Laina’s video and the subtext of Bieber’s career is that the hysterical love he inspires in his fans over-literalizes his sexual promise and so renders it asexual, perfect for a teen dream. Although some of Laina’s videos reference sex, her desire isn’t oriented towards sex, or even particularly towards a boyfriend; both are just means to maximal intensity of feeling.</p>

<p>&hellip; </p>

<p>The Tragic Heroine can get a lot out of a little. What she can’t do is find a balance between her inability to take a disgusting world seriously and her longing for connection. At first glance she seems anachronistic, a love traditionalist, but on reflection it is impossible to assign her to any particular era. Perhaps she is an anachronism from a time that has yet to come. In any case, the Tragic Heroine is usually a woman, not in the biological sense but in the sense that she perceives the world as happening inside her rather than extrinsically.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>Her love has no real narrative structure, although it’s very dramatic: She loves immediately, deeply, and forever, and if you want anything else in the way of plot you have to look elsewhere. Nothing develops or unfolds, she reaches maximal intensity and then stays there until she dies. Possibly the worst thing anyone could do to her is fully return her love. Then she would be stuck at home forever (like the tormented heroine of another Fassbinder film, Martha); then she could no longer be too much, violently rendered just enough.</p>

<p>&hellip; </p>

<p>Men could have loved women more, back when we still had full institutional heterosexuality, but they didn’t, because women are providers of services, not agents. They are luxury goods or bargains. In return women can do one of the following: attempt to be loved as such (provide incomparably excellent services); demand to be loved anyway (“see beyond my servitude!”), or forget about the whole thing. None of these choices is without some kind of pain. There must be another position, but we won’t find it on YouTube. </p>

<p>&hellip; </p>

<p>(this whole thing is really worth reading in its entirety.)</p>
