<h2>would you rather: transmasc shows up to first date at bar trivia night wearing fedora, ill fitting tweed vest and cargo shorts OR transmasc shows up to first date at bar trivia night wearing not just platform shoes but actual ~liberace~ platform shoes and gold booty shorts</h2>
<p>the implicit but unanswered question here is, of course, <em>how tight is your trivia game??</em> because [redirect to Hussy rule #1: THE HUSSY PLAYS TO WIN]; she can put up with a lot of bullshit for a $50 bar tab</p>
<p>like seriously she used to have a regular gig hosting one of brooklyn’s most intensely nerdragious bar trivia nights (multiple jeopardy winners in the audience) (by the by for a while this was like the only straightly acculturated thing she did and the only reason she did is so she could, like, write entire rounds that were like, “name this lesbian poet&quot;) and has been humiliated by perfectly decently dressed paramours in the audience making a terrible showing and having a boring team name</p>
<p>in that regard the fedora would fit right in but seriously tbh (and she RARELY says this) these trivia nerd rage weirdos irritate the one stridently antiassimilationist hair she has on her butt so what the hell bring on the booty shorts</p>
