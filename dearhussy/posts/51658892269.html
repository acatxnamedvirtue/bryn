<blockquote><p>I&rsquo;ve been kicking myself since Saturday for not saying hi, despite having that gorgeous smile flashed my way more than once. Luckily, you turned up on [xxx]&rsquo;s wall though, so I can look weird and send you a facebook message instead.</p>

<p>Maybe this is crazy (hopefully not), but if you&rsquo;re up for it I&rsquo;d love to buy you a drink sometime to make up for my shyness.</p></blockquote>
<p>the Hussy has decided to share this with you not in order to prove how pretty and popular she is (LIE #1: the Hussy fetishizes self-aggrandizement) but instead for its didactic function, which is to expose the TYRANNY OF AWKWARD, a blight on our community <br/><br/>the Hussy was giving this kid serious doe eyes the other night and getting NOTHING back, like, NOTHING AT ALL, to the point where she was concerned that she was being kind of creepy (LIE #2: the Hussy revels in creepy). so imagine her surprise at this fb missive, which, let&rsquo;s be honest, is about the only way to rebound after such a colossal acquiescence to the totes awk queer anti-flirt/anti-oed imperative</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s a good thing i&rsquo;m easy cuz if not tsssssssh</p>
