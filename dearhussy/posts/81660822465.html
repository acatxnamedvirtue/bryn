<h2>ABSTERGENCE</h2>
<p>they tried to make the Hussy go to rehab she said no no no</p>

<p>when you walk in the bar and you&rsquo;re dressed like a star rockin those f me pumps and you wall look the same but everyone knows your name and that&rsquo;s your whole claim to fame but you never miss a night cuz your dream in life is to be some half-acceptable masc&rsquo;s wife</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t like players that&rsquo;s what you say'a but you really wouldn&rsquo;t mind a millionaire (who went to slc and lives in a penthouse in williamsburg with his parents) you don&rsquo;t like ballers they don&rsquo;t do nothin for ya (unless they&rsquo;re the scion of an 80s one hit wonder who kicks his dog) but you&rsquo;d love a rich man <strike>6'2</strike>&ldquo; 5'2&rdquo; or taller</p>
<p>without girls like you there&rsquo;d be no fun we&rsquo;d go out and not know anyone without girls like you there&rsquo;s no nightlife all them men just go home to their wives and/or scruff accounts</p>
<p>with your big drag bag purse every week it gets worse at least your breasts cost more than hers don&rsquo;t be mad at me cuz yr well past thirty and yr old tricks no longer work</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s bricked up in my head and it&rsquo;s shoved under my bed and my destructive side has grown a mile wide and i question myself again: what is it &lsquo;bout men?</p>
<p>he left no time to regret kept his dick wet with his same old safe bet and all i can ever be to you is the darkness that we knew and this i&rsquo;ve grown accustomed to your shadow covers me the sky above a blaze that only lovers see</p>
<p>they tried to make the Hussy go to rehab and she said no no no<br/>she ain&rsquo;t got the the time and her daddy thinks she&rsquo;s fine <br/>no no no</p>
