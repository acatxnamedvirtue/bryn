<ul><li>The phrase ‘FtM’</li>
<li>The words ‘transman,’ ‘transguy,’ etc (no spaces)</li>
<li>Embarrassing facial hair</li>
<li>Posting youtube videos of their transition: “5 minutes, 23 seconds on T,&ldquo; “Negative 8 hours on T,&rdquo; “Guys I think I grew a chin hair!&ldquo;</li>
<li>Taking photos of their cocks to put on xtube</li>
