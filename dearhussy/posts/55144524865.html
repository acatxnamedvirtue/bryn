<h2>would you rather: russian nesting doll effect of doofy glitter cloak wearing transmasc with yet shorter doofy glitter cloak transmasc under cloak ad infinitum, all rolling d20 to see who has the best shot at climbing you OR entire coven of #transfags getting competitive over you as a 'fag hag' in a bid to affirm their #transfagsculinity</h2>
<p>the Hussy could never, ever a glitter cloak so i guess she would have to go with the latter which is sort of BASICALLY her life except #transfags in her experience don’t really need/want #hags because it’s about constructing a world without women (#newsies) but have at various points dragged her along for the ride because she is a really good social broker and can manage multiple highly #awkward personalities at once (as well as making sure people&rsquo;s various iterations of self-loathing don&rsquo;t clash too hard)</p>
