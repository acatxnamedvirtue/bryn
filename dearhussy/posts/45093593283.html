<h2>they closed the olfactory and springsteen wrote a song about it</h2>
<p>this gain dish soap is labeled &ldquo;lavender&rdquo; but actually it smells like the axe body wash he used which you think would be gross but actually made him smell amazing like it mixed with his body chemistry in this beautiful way and every time i inhaled it it was like if poppers were made of mdma and sandlewood and i was like okay it can&rsquo;t just be the axe i mean what are you 15 and constructing your gender via the semiocommodities of late capitalism in the cheesiest way possible but then the next guy i dated also used the exact same kind of axe body wash but he smelled totally different, like some tinny combination of talcum powder and ozone and i thought maybe it was because he was on the kind of t that you rub all over your body and it was metabolizing differently but then i was like the no wait the axe smelled good on the hot guy both before and after he started on t so i think in the end we just can&rsquo;t help which keys turn our pheromonal locks and it is a damn shame because frankly as a mate selection system it&rsquo;s fucking bullshit</p>
