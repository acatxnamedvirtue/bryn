<p>once i lived in a smaller town and there was this super gross femme who ran the trans programming at the local lgbt center. her thing was that she was really into trans dudes but only up right until the point where they started t (&ldquo;ew! smelly! hairy!&rdquo;). she would do this super manipulative thing where she would find these trans dude husbands but kind of like, scare them away from going on t by playing into their fears about everything. she had this line in her LIVEJOURNAL profile that her thing was that she &ldquo;like[d] to pick &lsquo;em off the tree before they&rsquo;re ripe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>my friend said to me when i told her about that, &ldquo;well, if we want to extend that metaphor, the Hussy likes 'em low-hanging and so rotten they&rsquo;re putrid.&rdquo;</p>
