<p>monsieur sehksmith somehow #targeted the Hussy with fb ads for this d/s MOOCification situation </p>

<p>&ldquo;I’ve been a sub for a long time, and I’ve dated lots of D-types, but I still want … more. More … something.”</p>

<p>the Hussy is well acquainted with this charactyr and i tell you what, has never met someone whose public persona is more divorced from thyr private self, which je used to describe as &quot;a quivering jello mold of lesbian anxiety&rdquo; </p>

<p>more *something* indeed</p>
