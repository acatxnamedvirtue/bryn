<h2><a href="http://ftmguide.rassaku.net/">THE FTM'S COMPLETE ILLUSTRATED GUIDE TO LOOKING LIKE A ^Hot DUDE</a></h2>
<p>PQ/Topside ed-in-chief <a href="http://leger.tumblr.com/">leger</a> passed this around the other day</p>
<p>the Hussy&rsquo;s response was like, <em>don&rsquo;t kids read laura mulvey in college anymore?? these guys need to know that the most feminine thing that can possibly happen to you is being looked at</em> #don&rsquo;t-gaze-me-bro</p>
<p>that said the Hussy has been known to send sarcastic subscriptions to DETAILS as christmas presents, but the implication in that gift is less <em>you need style advice</em> and more <em>you are a dirtbag</em></p>
