<blockquote>
<p>I know what you&rsquo;re thinking.</p>
<p>Gee whiz, why does my bookshelf not have a cool fantasy novel with<strong> a kickass transman of color</strong> as the protagonist?</p>
<p>A book which uses a pre-Iron Age fantasy world framework in the tradition of LeGuin and N. K. Jemisin, to look at all the complex ways sexuality, gender, and culture shape and bend and break us as human beings?</p>
<p>A book which also features<strong> a badass asexual warrior woman</strong>, and <strong>a quiet yet emotionally wise dude</strong>, and a family forged from love and loyalty rather than bloodlines?</p>
<p>Yeah, I know you want this book so badly you can practically <em>feel </em>the empty space it should fill on your bookshelf.</p>

<p>the Hussy looks forward to plying the writerly craft with her colleagues at the literary fellowship this summer<br/></p>
