<h2>HUSSY/INCEPTION</h2>
<p>when the staff at <a href="http://prettyqueer.com">PQ</a> were just getting things off the ground, I was hanging out at the office, irl trollin as usual, and i said to one of the editors, check this out. <br/><br/>remember when &lsquo;poking&rsquo; was sort of a thing on FB? i was all,<em> tell me:what do the five gentlemen who are currently 'poking&rsquo; me have in common?</em> and my colleague was like, they are all trans guys&hellip; who have serious girlfriends! why are they poking you? and i was like, because apparently i am some kind of <br/><br/>PASS-AROUND POKING BOTTOM<br/><br/>a week later word spread and they called me in (on father&rsquo;s day, even - psychological warfare!) to ask me to start writing <a href="http://www.prettyqueer.com/author/hussy">a column about sleeping with married trans dudes</a>. and i will tell you, the hussy is nothing if not obliging.</p>
