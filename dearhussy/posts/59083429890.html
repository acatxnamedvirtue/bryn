<h2>My Wedding Gown</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>This queer watering hole is ironically named Burroughs and I wonder what The Old Pervert would make of this scene of twenty-first century faggotry. What kind of virus would he summon upon these creatures of corporate identity and spray tanned taints? What riots would he incite upon witnessing the largest political-queer lobby swallowing the bitter cum loads of Goldman Sach publicists? How would the Man From Tangier respond to faggot politics mimicking heterosexual bondage or these asinine boycotts on deep-fried chicken being chewed and shat out by Republican women and retired Klansmen? </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>HITCH A RIDE TO THE WESTERN LANDS BOY. NO USE STANDING THERE IN THE PIG VOMIT AND REPTILIAN JIZZ. ERASE ERASE ERASE. THAT’S ALL YOU CAN DO.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>I stumble away from Burroughs and find myself lost in a black, plywood maze of loneliness. Silent men stand and shuffle in the dark corners of a ten-buck porno theater waiting for side-eye nods and open glory holes. I walk in drunk circles around married Mexican men, poz queens, and black trade in this little slice of homosexual heaven. There is no liberation here. The foul odor of stale piss, antibacterial gel, and open ass is all I can sense. A tweaked out faggot approaches me and asks if I’ll fuck his ass in one of the cubicles. </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>“I got a friend who wants to join,” he says with dilated pupils and teeth chewing the inside of his cheeks. </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>I pass and walk away toward an empty station. I sit alone in the metal chair and begin masturbating to vintage gay porn: black men from the 90’s massage throbbing cottonmouths and rough gods grunt in leather. The door to the station next to me opens and a young cub enters. He’s wearing a red shirt, cargo shorts and a backpack. He smiles at me through a red beard as he removes a stiff, pink rod from his pants. His pubes smell pungent like a herd of wet cattle. I kneel down on my knees and press my lips through the opening. The beat drops and the sound of soul drenched desperation reaches my ears: DON’T BE SURPRISED/ IF I NEVER LOVE AGAIN</p>
<p class="p1">The goal of love is to be brutal. As brutal as Saddam or Bush in confessing how fucked up you are without fear or hesitation. Love is to be naked in your desires, your lusts, your failures. A faggot is only human.</p>
