<blockquote><p>These days, a lot of people are seeking transgender medicine on the basis of what amounts to a self-diagnosis of transsexuality. This is dangerous and irresponsible. WPATH recommend this one simple trick to Know for Sure:</p>
<p>*** When your alcoholic parents were watching Cheers, who did you identify with? ***</p>
<p>- If you said Kirstie Alley, you are a Transgender Woman</p>
<p>- If you said Ted Danson, you are a Transgender Man<br/></p>
