<blockquote>
<p>ok. so the woman vocalist on Macklemore’s “Same Love” - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Lambert_(singer-songwriter)">Mary Lambert</a> - is an actual, real, living - as in irl - lesbian. And like, has an entire song based around the chorus she sings in “Same Love” - “She Keeps Me Warm”. She probably won’t get 1/10th the exposure that Macklemore is getting. She already doesn’t get much attention in a song that’s essentially supposed to be affirming her life.</p>
<p><a href="http://youtu.be/hlVBg7_08n0">&ldquo;Same Love&rdquo;</a> has 70+ million views on YouTube right now. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhqH-r7Xj0E">&ldquo;She Keeps Me Warm&rdquo;</a> has a little under 3,000. </p>
<p>That is a problem.</p>

<p>okay so i know it&rsquo;s boring to read a basic femme, especially when it&rsquo;s like, <em>what are you doing with your life Hussy </em><em>are you singing backup for Macklemore</em> NOPE, but</p>
<p>the opening quatrain of this song goes:<br/><em>she says i smell like // safety and home</em><br/><em>i named both of her eyes // &ldquo;forever&rdquo; and &ldquo;please don&rsquo;t go</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>in a coffee shop with too many ikea expedits where stalker femme flirts by giving lots of meaningful eyes and leaving a note in GREAT EXPECTATIONS (eww) which leads them to sharing a cab ride where there is gut-wrenchingly #awkward hand-holding (it is at this point when the Hussy would have been well into the beej actually) to a rooftop party exactly of the type that Maria finds so excruciating in <em>Nevada</em> to tentative tender nurturing <a href="http://dearhussy.tumblr.com/post/54686836265/greenhorn-replied-to-your-post-independence">brandon teena complex</a> smooching along the seattle skyline barf barf barf</p>
<p>allow the Hussy to write you a treatment for the third act of this VEVO:</p>
<p><em>basic modcloth femme gets more than she bargained for when basic boyscout shirt masc calls her to bail zerm out of jail. flashback to: the multiple arguments about the masc&rsquo;s tendency to text while driving, she&rsquo;s all </em>i feel really unsafe when you do that<em> and ze&rsquo;s all </em>it&rsquo;s my car i do all the driving w/e<em> and she&rsquo;s all </em>i know that you doing all the driving is part of our erotic dynamic<em> and ze&rsquo;s all </em>yeah so lay off me<em> and she&rsquo;s all </em>but having a car is a privilege and i am calling red on this situation<em>; cut to: red and blue lights after the masc got pulled over for texting and driving and actually gets arrested bc of an outstanding warrant which ze lies and tells femme is for shit-starting at the seattle WTO protests (cuz like give me a break you were like 11) but actually is just for unpaid speeding tickets which does not stop zerm from chalking the whole situation up to the racist colonialist genocidal legacy of the prison industrial complex and the femme is like yes all of that is true but god can you PLEASE just manage your life a little bit for chrissakes<br/></em></p>
