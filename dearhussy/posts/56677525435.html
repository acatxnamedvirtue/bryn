<p>when trans/queer/homos make fun of normie trans dudes for being normie dudes, in terms of fashion or masculinity or whatever.<br/><br/>it is actually cissexist to be extra dissapointed in their normie ways because they are trans!<br/><br/>it is actually way more embarrassing when you construct/represent yourself as teh most transgress1v3st on the block (cough those making the fun cough) and only do a c+ job of it.</p>

<p>also you know what a great way to manipulate someone is? make him feel constantly unhappy and uncertain and second-guess-y about every gendered choice he makes until he is nothing but a quivering jello mold of quasi-feminist guilt. he will feel so bad about himself that you can boss him into about anything! #houseboifun</p><p>a good time will be had by all, lemme tell you</p>
