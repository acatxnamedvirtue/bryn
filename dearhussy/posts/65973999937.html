<h2>Dear Hussy,  which is more egregious in terms of being "totally fucking awkward": referring to ID-Glide single serving lube packets as "awesome, like ketchup, ketchup that you fuck with" or bringing up Sandra Lee, queen of "semi-homemade" food and vodka based cocktails to poison your friends with, during coitus?  Sincerely yours and all thats, SG P.S. how much would you, theoretically, charge for a no limits bang sesh with Guy Fierri?</h2>
<p>the Hussy personally does not see any thing at all wrong with bringing up the First Lady of the Empire State whilst kickin it</p>
<p>the Sandra Lee media brand is all about how she pulled herself out of poverty and squalor with her 500-things-you-can-do-with-pie-filling tricksies, and now that bitch is living in the governor&rsquo;s mansion while NOT married to Andrew Cuomo (a top serious gravitational masc) and sending out instagram holiday cards, this is a v v Hussy-esque move, do approve</p>
<p>the other thing is like the worst kind of lena dunham poor imitator awkward, go back to oberlin ohio and work at the coop for a while longer and germinate and try again, geez, yuck</p>
<p>as for guy fieri ya sure the Hussy would cut his cruncy bangs though she probably would not like it and charge him double (which is actually only $30 since bang trims are $15)</p>
