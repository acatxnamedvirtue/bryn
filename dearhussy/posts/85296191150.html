<p>i was googling around for &ldquo;aphrodite urania&rdquo; and i found <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Androphilia-Manifesto-Rejecting-Reclaiming-Masculinity-ebook/dp/B0054SCR0E/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top">this</a> <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=k2PNM7kdKLwC&amp;lpg=PT60&amp;ots=sFYSDbmN5x&amp;dq=aphrodite%20urania%20gay&amp;pg=PT5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">intrigue</a></p>

<p>which like most gay kookiness contains a tiny nugget of truth, in this instance that: 1/sexuality is a lie and 2/masculinity is p cool and probably about more than yr haircut</p>

<p>but like most gay kookiness it spins off in all kinds of oddball directions. i legitimately thought it was a mid-90s reactionary heroic homosex HIV panic palpitation; in the vein of that kind of rhetoric, it kind of reminds me of hiv denialist bullshit socioepidemiology, and its instance that HAART was invented by the government to kill people living with AIDS. </p>

<p>(again, another kernel of reality: the government kills people living with AIDS all the time, just not that way.)</p>
