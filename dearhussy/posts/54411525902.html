<h2>What sort of phobic am I that all the femme ftms I've met make me want to vomit and die</h2>
<p>the Hussy was queried the other day as to what she thinks about femme ftms, which is what brought all this on in the first place</p>
<p>historically speaking, the Hussy has had little use for femme ftms and femme ftms little use for the Hussy, but here we are, it is a zeitgiest-y topic i guess</p>
