<h2>BABBLATIVITY</h2>
<p>at the insistance of her boyfriend, The Hussy is obligated to post the fan letter to a certain stentorian &amp; published elder statesman trans man she once wrote while she was *really high*:</p>
<p><i>hi! you probably get messages like this all the time but i have really enjoyed your work over the years. i’d like to keep in touch if you would also like that! </i></p>
<p>… (he wrote back really fast) </p>
<p><i>not to belabor the point/excessively famgirl</i>[sic] <i>out, but i thought your book was a very important book not only in that it groke</i>[SIC] <i>serious ground in terms of the testosterone memoir, but it alson</i>[SIIIC] <i>*told it it like it was*, ie, your own experience with transitioning, unvarnished by any veneer of (though i hate this phrase) *political correctness*. to write from the heart takes courage, and for that i applaude you. </i></p>
<p><i>and yes, it is SO COLD here, i can’t even step outside for a cigarette. what a bummer! </i></p>
<p>… and he wrote back again. quite a lot, actually. The Hussy would post it here, but it is easy to summarize it, it was basically like, <i>hey ma. </i></p>
<p>also, let’s face it, here there is no honor in the post-n-tell, it is not cute to catfish grandpa. </p>
