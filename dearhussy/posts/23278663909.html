<p>remember when we fucked on the beach last summer? the thing about fucking on the beach, or, for that matter, writing about fucking on the beach is that they&rsquo;re both really cheesy things to do.</p>
<p>the hard part about writing, or, for that matter, reading &ldquo;erotica&rdquo; is that affect defies language and cannot really be transferred. which is to say, when i got fucked on the beach that one time, i experienced all of these pre-verbal bodily intensities and whatnot, and they were like really really intense, but there&rsquo;s really no way for me to tell you about it so you will feel exactly like i felt. i mean, i guess that&rsquo;s the challenge, but for real, i could tell you about it, but you would be like, so you got fucked on the beach, so what.</p>
<p>and fucking on the beach, in particular, is laden with so much bodice-ripping waxed-chest romance novel crap that there&rsquo;s not even much that can be said about it. i mean i could tell you that i felt like i melted away from my body and turned into a breathing, expansive mareograph and i forgot where i ended and the rest of the universe began and i felt at one with &ldquo;nature,&rdquo; like &ldquo;nature&rdquo; was no longer that thing that was going on outside that i try to insulate myself from but a thing that i was a part of, that was inside me, that was all around me, that was me &ndash; or whatever, that might not mean much either.</p>
<p>but suffice to say that it was very cool. i wondered what you thought when those random guys were watching us, circling around us not like sharks but like, i don&rsquo;t know, pidgeons at the park when you sit down to eat a muffin, like how do they even know you&rsquo;re eating a muffin, but there they are, wanting you to throw them a piece. these guys did not exactly want us to throw them a piece, but maybe they thought if they got close enough we might be like, hey, wanna join in. which is weird, too, in a way, because like we&rsquo;re on the gay beach, so what do they even want with straight (&ldquo;straight,&rdquo; whatever) people fucking.</p>
<p>i have a guess that they were like, the kind of dudes who hung on at ten pm at the gay beach not because they identified in power-is-an-incitement-to-discourse kind of political category of &ldquo;gay,&rdquo; but because they were the kind of dudes who wanted to get their rocks off and like the ocean, and liked drinking 40s. and they were cheering us on, silently, and occasionally not so silently.</p>
<p>and i wondered how it was like for you, suddenly finding yourself in the sexual hunting grounds of men, participating in it, putting on a show. being a stud. fucking a girl on a blanket surrounded by empty bottles of cheap champagne (i know, i know, when we go for bodice-ripping we go for bodice-ripping.) while other guys are envious of you. or maybe they&rsquo;re envious of me for getting fucked by you. or maybe they&rsquo;re both. or maybe they&rsquo;re just bored and we are something happening on a tuesday night. it is almost september.</p>
<p>the fog rolled in and cloaked us and surrounded us and we breathed it in and then it was us. and my hair got all crazy. and we took the bus home and took a shower together, which i hate, but we did it by candlelight, which wasn&rsquo;t so bad. and we slept the sleep of the dead, by which i mean the sleep of people who became ghost, shadows and mist, by the sea.</p>
