<h2>do you talk like how you write/blog irl? it would seem like it could get exhausting</h2>
<p>in justin vivian bond’s current show at the public, MX. AMERICA, v sez that you can measure the extent of someone’s personal tragedy by the distance between how they see themselves and how they are seen by others; it is for this reason that the hussy hesitates to comment here</p>
<p>does the Hussy pepper her every day speech with funfacts learnt from the oxford english dictionary word-of-the-day emails and buzzwords from the queer academy? YES</p>
<p>is the Hussy a hopeless cunty bish who takes a very dim of the machinations of the heart’s darkest desires? YES, but that is not particularly unique or interesting i guess</p>
<p>v also tells a story about when v met melanie and she talked about herself in third person: “i appreciate when someone famous can step outside of themselves and comment on their own iconography”; it is in this dialectic between these two points that the hussy has attempted to answer this anon but she would appreciate some foucauldian biofeedback on this issue!! </p>
<p>this got rill “meta” real fast, as the kids say</p>
