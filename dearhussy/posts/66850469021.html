<p><strong>Some semiotechnical codes of white heterosexual femininity belonging to the postwar pharmacopornographic political ecology:</strong></p>
<p><em>Little Women, </em>a mother&rsquo;s courage, the Pill, the hyperloaded cocktail of estrogens and progesterone, the honor of virgins, <em>Sleeping Beauty, </em>bulemia, the desire for a child, the shame of deflowering, <em>The Little Mermaid,</em> silence in the face of rape, <em>Cinderella, </em>the ultimate immorality of abortion, cakes and cookies, knowing how to give a good blowjob, bromazepam, the shame about not having done it yet, <em>Gone with the Wind, </em>saying no when you want to say yes, not leaving home, having small hands, Audrey Hepburn&rsquo;s ballet shoes, codeine, taking care of your hair, fashion, saying yes when you want to say no, anorexia, knowing in secret that the one you&rsquo;re really attracted to is your best friend, fear of growing old, the need to be on a diet constantly, the beauty imperative, kleptomania, compassion, cooking, the desperate sensuality of Marylin Monroe, the manicure, not making any noise when you walk, not making any noise when you eat, not making any noise, the immaculate and carcinogenic cotton of Tampax, the certainty that maternity is a natural bond, not knowing how to cry, not knowing how to fight, not knowing how to kill, not knowing much or knowing a lot but not being able to say it, knowing how to wait, the subdued elegance of Lady Di, Prozac, fear of being a bitch in heat, Valium, the necessity of the G-string, knowing how to restrain yourself, letting yourself be fucked in the ass when it&rsquo;s necessary, being resigned, accurate waxing of the pubes, depression, thirst, little lavender balls that smell good, the smile, the living mummification of the smooth face of youth, love before sex, breast cancer, being left by your husband for a younger woman&hellip;</p>
