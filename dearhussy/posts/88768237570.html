<h2>HUSSY @ #PTHC v : The Inevitability of the OP Party, or, Further Thoughts on Thots</h2>
<p>the mascs at this thing are easy pickings because:</p>

<p>a) they are from the hinterlands &amp; are surprisingly perplexed that everyone wants to sleep with them,</p>

<p>b) they are on furlough from the weird poly gfs they left at home who won&rsquo;t sleep with them anyway,</p>

<p>c) this con is full perennially of (tryin to find the words to describe these girls without being disrespectful) (well ok i give up) thirsty sluts who come in no small part due to the seasonal monsoon of cock that descends on the city of brotherly love, and</p>

<p>d) a confluence of all the above</p>
