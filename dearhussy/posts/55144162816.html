<h2>would you rather: go back to they's place to find a desolate bookshelf except for a very well worn full collection of nancy drew titles OR go back to they's place to find a bedroom entirely decorated in Lisa Frank bullshit</h2>
<p><img alt="image" src="../media/tumblr_inline_mpr6n6PtI01qgbebw.gif"/></p>
<p>like i get that sometimes people get obsessed with the ephemera of adolescence/tween life because they themselves had an unhappy adolescence so they need to go back and revisit and revisit and revisit</p>
<p>and like sure adolescence is hot because it so much the site of the personal psychosexual erotic crucible even as much as (if maybe even for some people more so than) childhood but</p>
<p>man the aesthetics, particularly the visual aesthetics of tweendom SUCK and she just can’t, and seriously, the Hussy has TRIED</p>
<p>so she would probably go with the Nancy drew books, maybe the they reads them to go to sleep, that is a really good idea; the Hussy herself goes to sleep watching the BBC dramatizations of the Jane Marple mysteries and many of them are actually really good ruminations on postwar construction of bureaucratic identity &amp; the postindustrial pastoral</p>
