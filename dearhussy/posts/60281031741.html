<p>unpopular opinion time! </p>
<p>i hate going to queer shows where there will be queer cis men who might hit on me. and for that matter i hate going to queer shows where there might be trans womyn who hit on me - love you grrrl but letz just stick to trading tips on nail art &amp; how to carry awrite? i also hate going to queer shows where there are too many femmes cuz it is not a competition ok. also i hate going to queer shows where there are too many lesbians because like, they don&rsquo;t <i>get</i> my politics. also i hate going to shows where trans mans sing about cats or have cats or talk about cats because i am allergic to cats and i get psychosomatic hives #NoCatsCore</p>
<p>actually i think maybe my perfect queer show would be staying at home and loud singing along to the dirty dancing soundtrack while looking in the mirror and telling myself how pretty i am forever and ever and ever. i&rsquo;ll make an event on fb but you can&rsquo;t come :(</p>
