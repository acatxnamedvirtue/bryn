<p>I know, boring dream posts are boring, but last night I had an orgasm in my sleep. This happens to me every week, or maybe every other week. People seem to think that&rsquo;s really weird, but it&rsquo;s been happening to me most of my adult life. Also, I was dreaming I was having sex with this guy I only know via Facebook, and have never even met in real life. #creeper</p>
<p>In other news, I have this mild obsession with checking out like the trashiest of baby dykes on Fetlife. A 24 y/o Jewish Republican cheesy bodybuilder butch with extreme race fetishes who is probably also a racist! A 22 y/o with shaped eyebrows and Guido bling who posts pics of herself wearing a strap-on covered in her partner&rsquo;s menstrual blood (groups lead: Lavayan Satanists)! #creeper2themax</p>
