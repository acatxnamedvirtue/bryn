please do bear with the Hussy as she put her copy of <em>female masculinity</em> in a free box at a punk house because the typeface on the spine is too loud for her bedside bookshelf and thusly screams CHASER CHASER CHASER to the rotating cast of short hairy characters who occupy her boudoir but<br/><br/>as she recalls halberstam postulates a trope of ftm eroticism that is characterized by an obsession with commodified courtly love: flowers/candy/mix tapes/self-esteem-building sweet nothings etc &amp; more generally the embodiment of a nonthreatening tween heartthrob aesthetic, pulling from accounts of BTs dippy gfs to make a case for this<br/><br/>it has always been the Hussy&rsquo;s suspicion that uncle jack draws this distinction to contrast ftm-as-starry-eyed-eunuch with their own subjectivity as sleazy-faux-rough-trade &ldquo;&quot;outlaw&rdquo;&ldquo; academic butch, but this is mere dimestore psychoanalysis and not actual critical theory<br/><br/>in a way all this is prescient, as it prefigures &amp; predicts the leviathanic rise of the FTBELIEBER; though ultimately retrograde, as the ftm of today cares nothing for romance, preferring decorative genital piercing and piss pig play (<a href="http://vimeo.com/47185903">source</a>)</div>
