<p>and see the thing about dane was that he was that guy in your high school that is sort of popular but nobody knows exactly why because he is kind of creepy. which is to say, he is athletic (he is a basketball jock and a fb benchwarmer) and has a sharp mind, particularly for all those things analytic and math-brained, but he is always sort of mis-gauging social cues and he comes on a little too hard and little too strong and little too mean. he always over-interprets every friendly gesture as an invitation to fuck, which means he gets pretty rapey pretty fast, though he has always managed to skate by with his reputation marginally intact, other than being a creep, bc of, you know, rape culture (obviously.)</p>
<p>were it 2013, he would probably have a very active reddit account.</p>
<p>and see the thing about jessie is that he is a few years younger than dane, and a very soft boy, living with a single mom who is pretty checked out and not around much. and he is teen gay very much in the way that only baby gays can be gay: with exceptional sass and gusto. he plays the flute and he likes to draw and all his friends are girls bc teenage boys are weird and homophobic and cover up their anxiety with oppressive bravado and won&rsquo;t talk to him.</p>
<p>were it 2013, he would probably have a very active tumblr.</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s obvious that when dane starts gchatting jessie out of the blue one night like, <em>hey fag, why are you such a fag, fag?</em> that jessie is not off-put in an it-gets-better-omg-i-gotta-dieeee way, but merely bemused, because it&rsquo;s nothing he hasn&rsquo;t heard before, and in the unique position where he finds himself (starved of all masculine attention save from various old internet guys who want to fuck him) he responds to this as an invitation to a conversation and witty-banters back with bratty overtones.</p>
<p>and dane, unused to anyone who can handle the violence that he feels welling up inside him, unused to someone who sees it and recognizes it and does not run from it but instead engages it in a playful way, starts having all kinds of feelings, including but not limited to: FUCK HATE KILL LOVE DESTROY CHERISH DEFEND OBLITERATE.</p>
<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p>
<p>and it just got weirder from there, so much weirder, like did you see that buzzfeed article the other day about how deep the ocean is, like how the deepest we&rsquo;ve ever seen a blue whale is only a tiny fraction of how deep the ocean is? well this little set up is really just the blue whale of the worlds we created for each other. our own little private world where we would completely disappear to (<em>you guys fuck for 15 hours a week?? that&rsquo;s like a part time job!!</em>) to wrestle with our pasts, our demons, our narratives, our deepest insecurities. this is dark magic, but you handle it. you fucking handle your shit.</p>
<p>when you actually started calling yourself dane in real life, and then got it legalized, and everyone was cheering for you and patting you on the back about it, well&hellip; when i look back at everything, that&rsquo;s the moment when things really started to fall apart.</p>
<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p>
<p>should the Hussy write some kind of trans♒☆ pulp noir? the above is all a mess but i mean wouldn&rsquo;t that be some shit.</p>
