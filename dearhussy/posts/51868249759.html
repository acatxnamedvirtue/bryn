<p>the Hussy is cursed with competence, which makes day trading on the erotic market of butch labor so frustrating </p>

<p>like “just get it together or get out of my way” is unsexy &amp; emasculating; and yet, so is watching you flail and pretending i don’t notice </p>

<p>a 90s queercore dude came over today and said i hurt his butch feelings with a strained laugh that indicated he was trying to shrug it off but i actually did hurt his butch feelings a little bit</p>
