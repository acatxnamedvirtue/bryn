<h2><a href="http://www.queerty.com/study-gay-men-less-promiscuous-20130506/">STUDY: Gay Men Aren’t Sleeping Around As Much As They Used To</a></h2>
<blockquote class="link_og_blockquote">
<div>A new study suggests that gay men generally have &ldquo;significantly fewer&rdquo; sexual partners than they did 10 years ago. Comparing data from National Surveys of Family Growth in 2002 and between 2006-10, the study shows a consistent decline in sexual partners across most ethnicities and age groups, particularly men under the age of 24.</div>
