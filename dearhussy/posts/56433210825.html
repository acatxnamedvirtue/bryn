<p>the Hussy&rsquo;s friend was recently in a spoofy, schlocky musical about queer complicity in NY gentrification that included a pitch-perfect high femme burlesque performer type who had of late sunk her claws into the new boi in town and is explaining to him the <em>way</em> of things:</p>
<p><em>you don&rsquo;t know what a houseboi is?<br/>here&rsquo;s how it works<br/>you do boring things for me<br/>and admire my gender<br/>and tell me how great i am<br/><br/>and in return for this<br/>you get to do boring things for me</em><em><br/>and admire my gender<br/>and tell me how great i am</em></p>
<p>#ACCURATE</p>
<p>add this to the list of phenoms that puzzle the Hussy. like if you wanna be someone&rsquo;s slave why not just search &ldquo;internship&rdquo; on craiglist you know at least you might get some college credit or a metro card or occasional bagels &amp; wraps from craft services</p>
