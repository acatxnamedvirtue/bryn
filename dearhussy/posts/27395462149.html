<p>I am so funny sometimes. I wrote this several months ago in my journal and just went back and read it:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel about quitting him like I imagine a lot of people feel about quitting smoking. I don&rsquo;t really like him, and he&rsquo;s gross, and he leaves a gross stink on me, and people judge me for having him in my mouth all the time, but at the end of the day, he is intermittently comforting and we have spent a lot of time together, and my body has grown accustom to having a fix of him on a regular basis, and removing that has left me generally irritable and depressed and bitchy.&rdquo;</p>
