<p>I had this dream last night that because of some weird rent-paying scheme machinations, my roommates announced that they had invited my ex to live with us. They announced it at a big house meeting and he was there.</p>
<p>I confronted him and screamed at him. &ldquo;What is wrong with you? What the fuck are you thinking??&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said, &ldquo;I knew you would throw a fit. I actually made a pro and con list, to help me decide whether or not to take this step. Look at my biggest &lsquo;con&rsquo;: <em>She will be cruël to me.</em> And here, 'she&rsquo; means you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he actually showed me the list, and on the list, he had written it just like that. &ldquo;Cruël.&rdquo; With an umlaut, like they do in <em>The New Yorker</em>. Except they do not write it like &ldquo;cruël&rdquo; in <em>The New Yorker</em>, because the umlaut denotes an extra syllable where you might think there wouldn&rsquo;t be one, and only total tools pronounce &ldquo;cruel&rdquo; with two syllables. </p>
<p>The moral of the story is, don&rsquo;t ever ever ever date poets.</p>
