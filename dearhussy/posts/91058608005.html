<h2>SOME THOUGHTS ON THE NEW SEASON OF TRUE BLOOD</h2>
<p><b>Lafayette v. Jessica’s Boyfriend:</b></p>
<p>The Hussy loves a wounded masc/jaded femme dynamic, and ig a shared love of drugs is as sound a basis for a relationship as any. </p>
<p><b>Jason Stackhouse v. His 3000 y/o Vampire Girlfriend &amp; Their Trans-Temporal Relationship:</b></p>
<p>3kVGF: “Back in my day men were men! They were warriors and rapers and pillagers!” <br/>
Jason Stackhouse: “I AM MAN! But a modern man! With a hard cock! And now I’m going to fuck you with my extremely hard cock!”<br/>
3kVGF: “Well, alright then.” </p>
<p>^^The Hussy can certainly relate to the above scenario(s), especially the latter.</p>
