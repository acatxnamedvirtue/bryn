<h2>A KIND OF STUPID EXPERIENCE I HAD WITH A THERAPIST A LONG TIME AGO (and also a nice one i had, too)</h2>
<p>in <a href="http://partybottom.tumblr.com/post/70232746631/medicaid-mental-health-bureaucracy-sooooo-boring">this post</a> i said i have had a couple of really bad experiences with mental health practitioners. i would like to talk about some of them. this first one is not <em>très tragique</em> or anything, but i do think it impacted the course of my life in some significant way.</p>
<p>less than a year after i came out as trans, the apartment where i was living burned down. i was on technically-illegal hormones at the time, with no medical supervision. (where i was living at the time, it was very difficult and super $$$$$ to go the legal route.) i figured out my name change stuff by filling out legal forms i found on the internet. because my house had burned down, i was like, well, shit. i don&rsquo;t want to have to buy all boy clothes that i will just have to throw/give away after a while, so i might as well just go ahead and &ldquo;go full time&rdquo; (ugh, the early 2000s.) i was, at the time, enrolled at an enormous public state college, studying social work. </p>
<p>i was stressed out, to say the least. i had a lot of normal problems that 22 year-old college girls have: body image issues, self-esteem problems, boys, blah. i went to the college mental health clinic to make an appointment with a therapist. </p>
<p>i told her basically ^^^ (minus illegal hormones part) and this is what she said to me:</p>
<p><em>i don&rsquo;t feel competent to treat you because i have never met a transgender person before. it would be like if someone came in requesting a letter of psychiatric recommendation for gastric bypass surgery, and i had never met a fat person before. i&rsquo;m sorry, but i can&rsquo;t help you. </em></p>
<p>i tried to explain to her that i was not looking for her to sign off on any letters &ndash; there was <em>no way </em>(i thought at the time) i would be able to afford any surgery at any time in the then-near future. i just wanted to talk about being depressed and anxious. </p>
<p>still, she refused to treat me. </p>
<p>eventually, the anxiety and stuff got so bad that i stopped going to classes and dropped out of school and got a job (which paid $7/hour.) to this day, i have never finished college. </p>
<p>i am not <em>blaming</em> this counseling lady for my dropping out. but it&rsquo;s like, when trans people reach out for help &ndash; help that they really need &ndash; and are smacked down, there can be serious consequences, that range from mild set-backs to the heart-breakingly tragic. i mean i guess in a way it&rsquo;s good that she admitted her incompetence? but in a way i wish she had not just dismissed me, especially after i had admitted all the deeply personal things that i had admitted to her during a psych intake (anyone who has ever been through one of these will know what I mean.)</p>
<p>BUT BECAUSE PARTYBOTTOM IS ALL ABOUT POSITIVITY, i will end on a nice note. unexpectedly, it wasn&rsquo;t until i was diagnosed a few years later that i found a really good therapist who i was able to see through an ASO (AIDS service organization &ndash; like a nonprofit that provides services to HIV+ people.) here&rsquo;s the weird thing: i was 25 at the time, and she was 23. she had just graduated from the very same program that i had dropped out of. </p>
<p>can i repeat, she was <em>twenty-three years old</em>? i remember, on our first visit, she leaned over to throw something away in the trash and she had, like, a full on tramp stamp on her lower back! i was was like, oh lord jesus. </p>
<p>but you know, even though she didn&rsquo;t have that many trans clients and didn&rsquo;t know a whole lot about trans stuff, she was just open-minded enough to be caring and warm. it was a very fruitful therapeutic relationship that lasted for three years. she helped give me the courage to publish my writing for the first time, and eventually to move to new york. </p>
<p>(i know i have complained about bright-eyed baby social workers before, but i will make a distinction here: her job was not to be my <em>case manager</em><em>, </em>ie, someone who helps you navigate all the conflicting systems that control your life when you are living in poverty with a chronic illness, it was to be my therapist: to listen to my problems and feelings, to offer empathy and insight, and to help with the acquisition of the right set of emotional coping skills, whatever that looks like.)</p>
<p>in fact, us both being so young and so close in age really worked out well in some ways. i could be all like, <em>okay, this will sound ridiculous, but kimora lee simmons said this thing on the style network the other day that really resonated with me, </em>and she would be like <em>actually, i saw that episode of LIFE IN THE FAB LANE and i know exactly what you mean by that.</em></p>
<p>and she really did, is the thing. sometimes i think that&rsquo;s all it takes.  </p>

<h2>MY DOCTOR SAID SOMETHING FUNNY THE OTHER DAY.</h2>
<p>as i mentioned in <a href="http://partybottom.tumblr.com/post/69999550361/awesome-visit-to-the-doctor-bonus-breast-exam-411">this post</a>, during my annual physical, i had a prostate exam. while i was bent over the table and my doctor had his finger up my ass (a sensation to which partybottom is certainly no stranger), he noticed a band-aid on my butt. </p>
<p>he said, <em>it looks like </em><em>somebody gave you a shot. who gave you a shot?</em> and I said, oh, my boyfriend gave me my hormone shot the other day. and i added, fun fact: he&rsquo;s transgender, too. </p>
<p>toward the end of the appointment, he was like, <em>okay, so, now, i&rsquo;m really sorry, but i&rsquo;m going to have to ask you a bunch of annoying questions. </em>and i was like, sure, ask away doctor! i will tell you anything you want to know, since you seem like a nice guy. (i was in a good mood.)</p>
<p>i realized very quickly that this was the &ldquo;harm reduction counseling&rdquo; part of the appointment. this kind of thing is mandated by the state &ndash; they have to do it to get funding, and i suppose it probably is a decent part of good health care, too. basically, he was asking a bunch of questions about substance use, med adherence (how often i take my meds and if i take them on time), and safer sex. </p>
<p>when we got to the sex questions, he starts out, <em>have you had sex since i saw you last? </em>and i enthusiastically answered, yes! then he was all, <em>do you have a partner? </em>and i was was like, yup. and then he was like, <em>are you monogamous? </em>and i was like, eh, yeah, more or less. and then he was like, <em>do you guys use condoms?</em> and i was like uuh, um, i mean, not really, i mean we don&rsquo;t really need to because we don&rsquo;t really have high-risk sex, i mean, the thing is, it&rsquo;s like&hellip;</p>
<p>and he goes,</p>
<p><em>OOOooh i remember, you said your boyfriend is transgender! so, he uses a strap-on or something? </em>and i was like YES, EXACTLY, TRUE, THAT IS EXACTLY HOW WE HAVE SEX.(actually, he uses a <a href="http://www.babeland.com/tantus-realdoe/d/1342">realdoe</a>, but no need to split hairs here.) and then my doctor was like, <em>psssh, you should have just said. this is APICHA, we hear everything. no judgement! what, you think i believe in abstinence or something? what, do i look like nancy reagan? </em></p>
<p>which is funny, because dr. tang does not look like nancy reagan. like, not even a little bit. </p>
<p>i guess you had to be there. </p>

<h2>MEDICAID MENTAL HEALTH BUREAUCRACY: Sooooo boring.</h2>
<p>i spent three hours on the phone today (attempting to) make medical appointments</p>
<p>in particular i am having trouble finding a therapist. my medicaid HMO farms out its mental health services to ANOTHER sketchy &ldquo;behavioral health&rdquo; HMO. i called them and asked for mental health clinics not too far from my neighborhood that take my particular insurance. <br/><br/>she cheerfully gave me three referrals with three different phone numbers. all three phone numbers were incorrect &ndash; either i got a recorded answer saying &ldquo;this is no longer the number for this service, please call this other number&rdquo; or the number was disconnected entirely. i ended up googling the names of the clinics she listed, and after trying about five different numbers, eventually i found the correct phone number for all three clinics. </p>
<p>(it is worth noting here that this is far from the first time that having computer skills has supplemented my navigation of the welfare system. having internet access and literacy is something that many, many people in this system do not have. thus, even though most of the time i feel like a broke down bitch, i also recognize how lucky i am in many, many ways.)</p>
<p>the first clinic no longer takes my insurance, even though my insurance company says it does. the second clinic has recently restructured, and is &ldquo;unsure&rdquo; if they take my insurance, and said they&rsquo;d get back to me. at the third, i only got a voice mailbox &ndash; however, it is at a hospital that i happen to know recently went bankrupt and may close basically any day now. </p>
<p>however, i still feel fortunate, and hopeful: to have insurance, to have access to health care, to have a gp that will manage my mental health meds on a casual basis until i can find a &ldquo;real&rdquo; psychiatrist (and let&rsquo;s face it, most medicaid psychiatrists are like, 15-appointment, revolving-door medicine types) and hopefully (whoa boy i hope) a decent therapist. </p>
<p>PS i have NO IDEA if any of these places are &ldquo;trans&ndash;friendly.&rdquo; i am pretty much just jumping in feet first. i&rsquo;m faaairly good at advocating for myself in the mental health system and generally therapists like me (i &ldquo;display a high degree of insight into my problems&rdquo; ie i have the language skills of someone who went to college for a while), and so unless something goes terribly wrong, i&rsquo;m generally able to be nbd about mental health providers who are like ???? about trans stuff. </p>
<p>that said, i have had some experiences with being trans in the mental health system that range from merely facepalm-y to truly frightening, which i will blog about more some time later. </p>

<p>I get random big lumps from time to time and when I go in to the clinic for it, they’ve always said everything’s fine. They explained that I should be more worried about a hard pebble-like bump appearing than bursts of crazy hormonally-induced swelling.</p>
<p>Even most of the times I’ve had plugged milk ducts and non-acute mastitis, they say I’m welcome to come get checked out for peace of mind, but that if I’d rather not (which is the case), most cases of mastitis will resolve on their own without abx.</p>

<h2>Tell us more about yourself? What is your age, where you grew up, favorite color, sweet thing?</h2>
<p>partybottom now struggles with two conflicting impulses: <em>loving </em>to talk about herself, and not wanting to blow up her spot too much, because HIV stigma is still very, very real. but here are a few things:<br/><br/></p>
<ul><li>i am in my early thirties. (tw: boring queer/trans cred story ahead): i came out as gay when i was 13, started going to gay bars/hanging out with drag queens/dressing up in drag when i was 16, and started on hormones around the age of 20. in fact, i just passed my 11 year anniversary of HRT. whoo hoo?<br/><br/></li>
<li>i grew up in the US, mostly in the south and some in the midwest — all over appalachia, basically. my dad was a construction worker and he moved around a lot. my mom was a public school teacher so she did not. they were divorced. we were working class, but not poor. like, think the <em>roseanne</em> show before she got transphobic. i am white. <br/><br/></li>
<li>I started hanging out in/coming to New York about twelve years ago, and moved here full time six years ago. i primarily consider myself an artist/writer. i am on welfare.(welfare is something i really need to talk about on this blog).and have a couple of side hustles to make a little extra money. i have done sex work in the past (cam and escorting), but i do no longer. i am not anti-sex work; it’s just not for me, and i try to do anything i can to avoid having to do it. <br/><br/></li>
<li>i have volunteered at the <a href="http://www.srlp.org">sylvia rivera law project</a> for the past six years, and am currently part of their <a href="http://www.change.org/petitions/ny-governor-andrew-m-cuomo-and-nys-health-department-commissioner-dr-nirav-shah-stop-excluding-trans-and-gender-non-conforming-people-from-receiving-safe-and-affordable-healthcare">trans medicaid access campaign</a>. i also try to support events that raise money for other racial/social justice/hiv/harm reduction orgs like: the audre lorde project, FIERCE, (the now defunct) queers for economic justice, VOCAL: the new york user’s union, and the nyc harm reduction coalition, etc. /boring activist resume.<br/><br/></li>
<li>my favorite color is purple! specifically, <a href="http://www.theskinnystiletto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/laura-carmichael-1-michelle-dockery-5-jessica-brown-findlay-1.jpg">dusty lady mary crawley purples</a>. my friend today told me that i have “good branding and a strong visual language that i may not recognize” because i have basically been using this same color scheme since my livejournal in 2003;</li>
</ul><p>BONUS FUN FACT:<br/>my icon is of the character empress nympho from the movie <em>history of the world: part i. </em>i am eh blah about mel brooks but I think madeline khan is a comedic genius. specifically in this scene:<br/><br/><br/></p>

<h2>AWESOME VISIT TO THE DOCTOR (BONUS: BREAST EXAM 411)</h2>
<p>to cleanse the palate from that <a href="http://partybottom.tumblr.com/post/69991030540/i-feel-like-its-dumb-to-fault-a-faab-person-with-not">last nasty ask</a>, i want to tell you about a good visit i had to the doctor:<br/><br/>i have never had a physical in my adult life. i had decent pediatric care as a kid (they knocked my knee with a little rubber mallet), but after age 15, i have never seen a doctor for a visit that took longer than 20 minutes. </p>
<p>the doctor&rsquo;s appointments I used to have at Big Gay Health, Inc. were, like&hellip;. fine? I guess? As I said before, they generally consisted of reviewing my numbers (viral load and CD4) to see if I was taking my HIV meds. If there was a bounce in my viral load, they would lecture me about med adherence (my particular regimen must be taken every day, at the same time every day, with food). <br/><br/>(The other reason for these visits is frankly, kind of a policing one. If you are being prescribed meds but your bloodwork shows that you are not responding to them &ndash; your CD4 count stays the same, and your viral load does not decrease &ndash; it is assumed that you are selling your meds, probably to undocumented people, and there is the possibility that you will get in big trouble.)</p>
<p>ANYWAY, this was my first full physical in many years. Like, the nurse telling me to strip down to a little paper gown and everything. Speaking as a trans woman, this is normally something that would <em>freak me the fuck out,</em> but my nurse and doctor had such good bedside manner and gave me plenty of time and privacy to change that it felt like nbd. </p>
<p>And can I tell you, they checked EVERYTHING out? The whole thing took an hour and a half, and they checked out everything they possibly could, both in person and via the results of my bloodwork. Eyes, ears, nose, thoat, abdomen, and even &mdash; oh Lord my Lord! GENITALS, BREASTS, and PROSTATE.</p>
<p>Again, as someone  who is often very private about my body, particularly in medical contexts and particularly around strangers and particularly around male authority figure medical strangers, this normally would have sent me into a panic attack. But the doctor was just so kind, so sweet, so funny and made the whole thing seem so <em>normal</em> that I was totally okay with it. </p>
<p>(I also got an anal pap while I as there. I have mixed feelings and general unresolved questions about the effectiveness/alarmist/overall public health value of the anal pap, but that&rsquo;s a post for another time.)</p>
<p>The last thing I want to say about this nice visit to the doctor was this: learning to do a breast exam felt like a big fucking deal. He asked me if I do self-breast exams every month, and I like, <em>uhhh, I have seen like pamphlets about how to do it, but I honestly don&rsquo;t even know what I&rsquo;m feeling for. </em>Which is true! I have dated men all my life, thus I have not gone around feeling a lot of titties, so I don&rsquo;t even know what &ldquo;normal&rdquo; breast tissue is supposed to feel like. </p>
<p>(Especially because, you know how when trans girls&rsquo; breasts are developing, it can feel kind of hard and fibrous right under the nipple? I&rsquo;m all like, is that that &ldquo;normal&rdquo;? Who fucking knows?)</p>
<p>Anyway, what he told me was that what you&rsquo;re looking for is any breast tissue that feels different from the rest of the breast tissue. Like anything fibrous or lumpy or w/e. Idk, if you can find a compassionate medical provider, please please do yourself a favor and have him or her show you how to do this, it is so easy and knowing that you&rsquo;re doing it correctly is (or at least, has been for me) a major weight off my mind. <br/><br/>tl;dr: went to the Dr., got poked and prodded a lot, feel good about it</p>

<h2>I feel like it's dumb to fault a FAAB person with not connecting with you on the level that a MAAB person did. Like, of course someone who has way more in common with you is going to connect with you more. I'm willing to bet FAAB people wouldn't connect to her as much. And sorry, but putting hair removal on the same level of importance of finding a supportive doula? Really? Good lord.</h2>
<p>When I first started this blog, I was, like, <em>does the world really need another transmisogyny complaining blog? Does everybody need to know my business? Why should I be writing about health care, I am no expert! Writing about my visits to the doctor will be so boring.</em></p>
<p>BUT THEN I GET AN ASK LIKE THIS AND I REALIZE THAT, YES, IT IS TIME TO GO TO SCHOOL. </p>
<p>First off, I reject “FAAB/MAAB” language. I understand it is helpful for some people to understand their bodies/experiences in certain ways, but it is just something I would prefer not to use in my own writing. (For the uninitiated, these terms stand for “female-assigned at birth” and “male-assigned at birth” and are used by trans people to talk about their bodies/lives/experiences. I know this news is old hat to some people, but I think it’s important bc I realize a lot of people are finding my blog through the #hiv tag and might not have the background in trans lingo.)</p>
<p>Moreover, the FAAB/MAAB distinction here totally misses the point of what I was trying to say. At the risk of <a href="http://partybottom.tumblr.com/post/69912399178/a-tale-of-two-trans-care-program-case-managers">repeating myself</a> (and I <em>hate</em> repeating myself), what I was trying to get at is that hiring practices in public health privilege fancy education over life experience, and that is a really big problem. </p>
<p>(Also, like I said, it’s not really about a matter of “connection.” I was/am friends with the “FAAB” case worker i was talking about in <a href="http://partybottom.tumblr.com/post/69912399178/a-tale-of-two-trans-care-program-case-managers">that post</a>. We have known each other for years and years and I feel I could tell her anything. I am actually a little afraid she will stumble on that post and her feelings will be hurt. A big part of the problems she experienced in that job were a matter of normal healthcare nonprofit overwork/underpay/too much need for care/not enough resources. But the fact stands that my new case manager is just better at helping me find the resources I need, and I think that has a lot to do with the fact that she has a lot of personal life experience with the communities she serves.)</p>
<p>Here’s the thing about social work/case management: it’s all relationships, knowing where the goodies are hidden, and people owing each other favors. Kids who move to the city fresh out of college and do not have intimate experiences with (and perhaps more importantly do not <em>come from</em>) the communities they are trying to work with are just, generally speaking, less effective at their jobs because they don’t have the right connections to make things work out. These kinds of professional networks take <em>years</em> to establish. Especially in this city (New York) with its labyrinthine social service network. </p>
<p>And as for your last comment about the value of doulas-versus-hair removal for trans women: Jesus Christ, I don’t even know where to start with that. You may think that dealing with facial hair/electrolysis is like some superfluous cosmetic thing, but it is such a deeply felt self-esteem problem for so many trans women, not to mention one of the main factors of passing/not passing on the street, getting harassed, being a victim of violence, and generally being afraid to leave your fucking house. I don’t know how to express to you how deeply mistaken you are with your dismissiveness on this issue. </p>

<h2>Hi! Im a somewhat closeted trans girl id love to know about the clinic you mentioned in your last post where your advisor was a trans woman. Where is this wonderful place and do any of these places take people without insurance? Love your blog. You're wonderful. Thank you.</h2>
<p>partybottom is about to NAME NAMES:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.apicha.org/">http://www.apicha.org/</a></p>
<p>they’re not kidding around: it is easy and fast to get an appointment there. i called and said, “i’m a new patient, when can i schedule an intake?” and the receptionist (who is SUPER NICE) said, “well, how’s tomorrow at 11am?”  <br/><br/>i’m sure they have many of the same problems as many nonprofits/community health clinics, but i have gotten very good care there, which is something i plan on writing about more in the future. </p>
<p>they *do* take uninsured patients, and they *do* take undocumented patients. in fact one of the only “problems” (and it’s not really a problem, for me anyway) that i ran into was that i cannot access mental health services there, since they save most of the slots in the mental health program for undocumented patients, which, hey, is fine with me, because i am lucky enough to have public insurance (Medicaid.) besides, a social worker spent an hour with me the other day calling around to find a good trans-friendly mental health clinic that will take my insurance, so i am feeling hopeful about it. if you are looking for mental health help, and for whatever reason do not qualify for mental/behavioral health services there, i bet they would help you find a good free/sliding scale mental health clinic, too.  (though keep in mind, i am not an expert or a social worker, just a patient with a blog.) :D</p>
<p>fun fact: APICHA gets really good reviews on Yelp. My doctor actually mentioned this to me: <em>I mean I’m not complaining that people like us but I think it’s so weird! It’s not like we’re a restaurant or something! </em>He’s a funny guy. <br/><br/>Anyway, best of luck to you! I hope it works out for you and you get good care. You deserve it. &lt;3 &lt;3</p>

<h2>A TALE OF TWO TRANS CARE PROGRAM CASE MANAGERS</h2>
<p>As I mentioned in my last post, I have been receiving all my health care from Big Gay Health, Inc., NYC (many of you know where I am talking about) for the last six years.</p>
<p>During the time I was there, they hired a case manager specifically to work with trans clients. <em>Here&rsquo;s the thing</em>: I have known this person for several (12+?) years and am really not trying to shade them. I believe their heart is in the right place, but there are some institutional problems that lead to trans women getting bad care at places like this.</p>
<p>The trans care coordinator they hired at Big Gay Health, Inc was a white, female-assigned (FAAB, I believe, as the kids say these days) genderqueer  with an advanced degree in divinity studies from an Ivy League university. They were friendly. They were overworked. They had had several social-work type jobs before, but never (AFAIK) stayed with the same organization for more than two or three years. (Turnover in social services is a BIG PROBLEM for people who depend on these services, but that is a blog post for another time.) (They have since left this position to go to div school. Again. This time, for a different religion.)</p>
<p>As part of their job, a few years ago it was this coordinator&rsquo;s job to compile and release a &ldquo;comprehensive&rdquo; guide to trans health and wellness resources in the New York area. It was downloadable as a .pdf, so I perused it. I noticed that though it contained no resources for electrolysis, laser providers, or hair removal specialists of any kind, it listed no less than <em>six</em> birth doulas. I sent a FB message to the coordinator (again, we were/are friends) to say &ldquo;Hey, um&hellip; did you notice..?&rdquo; and the answer I got back was like, herp derp, we&rsquo;re still searching, it&rsquo;s a work in progress, non-pology.</p>
<p>(The resource guide has since been updated to include hair removal, but IDK anything about the practitioners in it.)</p>
<p><em><strong>IN</strong><strong> CONTRAST</strong></em>, I recently switched health care providers to a smaller clinic whose main populations are men of color who have sex with men, HIV+ people, lesbians (LOTS of studs &amp; AGs in the waiting room always), sex workers, undocumented patients, and trans people. I was able to get an appointment there very quickly.</p>
<p>The intake was nbd, but one of the best parts was getting to meet the trans care coordinator there. She is a bilingual Argentine immigrant trans woman (I learned this from her bio on a workshop flyer). She is so smart and friendly and awesome. Here is what she said to me:<br/><br/><em>Girl! You look good! And it looks like you got your name changed, your ID changed, your Medicaid straight, your hormones. </em>(She looks at my chart) <em>Oh and it looks like you got the orchiectomy too! That must be why you look so soft. I&rsquo;ve been thinking about doing that too. So, what do you need from me?</em></p>
<p>I told her, well, sometimes I&rsquo;m a little self-conscious about the facial hair I have left. Do you know any good electrologists? She said,</p>
<p><em>You know I get a little bit of this-this </em>(points to her face) <em>sometimes, too. Did you know there&rsquo;s an electrology school way out in Queens? The girls that work there have had like 700 hours of training, they just need to get their last 300 clinical hours so they need people to work on. It&rsquo;s free, or maybe $20 an hour or something like that. Hey, here&rsquo;s my personal email - email me sometime and we&rsquo;ll go together and make a day of it. </em></p>
<p>I was fucking <em>agog. </em>I have never had a provider be so sweet, kind, and real with me &ndash; not to mention giving me such USEFUL INFORMATION. (Speaking of which, I will be posting about that referral shortly.)</p>
<p>Point is, I think it all comes down to hiring practices. If you prioritize education and being able to speak a certain kind of social-work-y, tenderqueer vernacular, you will get providers who can provide services for white, FAAB, transmasculine people. If you prioritize hiring people from the communities you hope to serve &ndash; people who have <em>lived the life</em> &ndash; you will serve those communities, and, hopefully, serve them well. <br/><br/>(<em>Nota bene</em>: I did not invent these ideas, I just happen to be living them. Activist and artist Mirha Soleil-Ross has been talking about this kind of thing for years, and academic Viviane Namaste lays down the extended remix in her book <em>Invisible Lives</em>. Canadians, I tell you what.)<br/><br/>tl;dr: best trans care social worker story ever.</p>

<h2>EXPERIENCES WITH TRANS/HIV HEALTH CARE IN NYC: PART 1</h2>
<p>The other day I nearly ran out of my HIV meds and I called my pharmacist to ask about a refill. She called me back and told me that my doctor would deign to refill my prescription, but would write no more refills unless she saw me within a month. She insists I go for &ldquo;check ups&rdquo; &ndash; these last about 20 minutes, during which she is generally like, TAKE YOUR MEDS, and OH, YOU HAVE ANXIETY? YOU SHOULD TRY MEDITATION &ndash; about four times a year.</p>
<p>So I called The Big Trans Health Clinic, Inc. (everybody in NY knows exactly where I&rsquo;m talking about) on November 2nd and asked to make an appointment with my doctor. The receptionist said, &ldquo;Hmm&hellip; the earliest we have available is on New Year&rsquo;s Eve? Could you come in then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clearly this presents a problem, because I need to take these meds EVERY DAY or I will develop resistance to them and have to change regimens, which could lead to (even more) highly unpleasant side-effects.</p>
<p>I believe that Big Trans Health Clinic, Inc, while being a great resource for many people (including a <em>certain kind</em> of queer &ndash; I will go into that more later) has overextended itself. It is over capacity; it has taken on too many clients and cannot care for the volume of patients that depend on them for ALL their health needs.</p>
<p>BUT THIS STORY DOES NOT HAVE AN UNHAPPY ENDING. I found a great alternative health care center which I am very excited about, and will tell you all about in a future post.</p>

<p>as someone living with HIV/AIDS, <br/>this is what it takes to keep me alive every day </p>
