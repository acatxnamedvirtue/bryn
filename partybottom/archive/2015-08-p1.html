<h2>This is ridiculous, paranoid and highly offensive of me to ask but I am freaking out I gave a homeless man food on Saturday and for a brief moment I turned away from him. Only our hands grazed(when I gave him food) and then I left. There is 0% chance he stuck me with anything right? Like...wouldn't I have felt it? There is zero thousdan% chance I was infected with any thing, right? I am sorry to be so ignorant, but I am a germphobe & hypocondriac.</h2>
<p>dear tumblr, you might be very surprised to hear about the number of anons like this i get! and i am not alone. if you visit thebody.com you will find by far the most active HIV education forum is the &ldquo;do i have AIDS????!!&rdquo; forum. most of the posts are like, &ldquo;i was in brazil  and i saw a sex worker, maybe i have AIDS??!!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>dear anon, i am 110% sure that you did not contract HIV. that said, it seems like you have a lot of anxiety! which might be worth talking to someone about.</p>

<p>to me the more interesting question is not whether or not you contracted HIV or whether or not your concern is &ldquo;offensive&rdquo; but rather, the process by which HIV marks bodies that are perceived to be unclean, regardless of the actual presence of HIV. this is very old meme but susan sontag&rsquo;s <i>AIDS and its metaphors</i> and the idea of &ldquo;moral plague&rdquo;: still relevant!</p>
