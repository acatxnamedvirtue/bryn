<h2>So I've been diagnosed with HIV around 2-3 years ago and I also suffer from depression and I keep stopping my pills and get sick and take them again till I feel better then my depression get to me and I stop again. All that is not important, I just want to know how you keep strong and keep on taking those pills? Is it prayer? Is it family? Afraid of death? Because I don't pray, family are busy and I'm not afraid to die. I'm basically a walking disaster.</h2>
<p>do not despair anon! taking the pills is just a habit. partybottom has been at the bottom of that garbage can of disaster too and occasionally stopped taking ARVs for some time. here are my honest answers why i keep climbing back on the wagon and taking the anti-HIV pills:</p><p>.1 taking the pills to me is like the minimum insurance that okay, today i feel like human garbage, but perhaps tomorrow i will not, so might as well take them today on the chance that if i feel less like garbage tomorrow, i will have a degree of “health” to work with. </p><p>.2 generally speaking, when your viral load jumps, your body’s immune system reacts and tries to fight it, which causes a generalized inflammation response. it makes your body tired to fight a virus all the time. so weirdly sometimes ppl have *more* energy and feel *better* about things when they take the pills. or at least get a little lift. which might make you feel a little less like a human garbage pail. </p><p>.3 if you get into the groove of taking your meds you can get really dramatic about adherence and make everyone else in your life miserable complaining about it which sucks for them but is really fun for you. “what do you MEAN you said you would pick up my meds for me but the pharmacy was closed! i have to take them EVERY DAY WITH 99% ADHERENCE WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME!!!!??” {{faints on victorian sofa}}</p><p>.4 they make you a little less likely to die of AIDS (or “complications”) which can be a really scary and painful way to go! we are all going to die so why not hold out for something more exciting and glamorous, like terrorism victim or eaten alive by bears!</p><p>.4 finally and most importantly,<br/>– YOU HAVE TIGER BLOOD AND ADONIS DNA –<br/>– YOU HAVE BECOME A CYBORG GOD/DESS –<br/>– YOU ARE EVOLVED BEYOND THE GRASP OF A MERE VIRUS THAT HAS CLAIMED THE LIVES OF 39 MILLION PEOPLE – <br/>– YOU ARE THE GHOST IN THE MACHINE –<br/>– YOU ARE THE BASTARD STEP DAUGHTER OF STATE SOCIALISM AND GLOBAL CAPITALISM –<br/>– YOU ARE NEW PHARMACOPORNOGRAPHIC REGIME –<br/>– YOU – <br/>– HAVE –<br/>– T I G E R – <br/>– B L O O D –<br/><br/>take them pills bb</p><figure data-orig-width="600" data-orig-height="427" class="tmblr-full"><img src="../media/tumblr_inline_nxy4e023t51qgbebw_1280.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="600" data-orig-height="427"/></figure>
