<h2>EXPERIENCES WITH TRANS/HIV HEALTH CARE IN NYC: PART 1</h2>
<p>The other day I nearly ran out of my HIV meds and I called my pharmacist to ask about a refill. She called me back and told me that my doctor would deign to refill my prescription, but would write no more refills unless she saw me within a month. She insists I go for &ldquo;check ups&rdquo; &ndash; these last about 20 minutes, during which she is generally like, TAKE YOUR MEDS, and OH, YOU HAVE ANXIETY? YOU SHOULD TRY MEDITATION &ndash; about four times a year.</p>
<p>So I called The Big Trans Health Clinic, Inc. (everybody in NY knows exactly where I&rsquo;m talking about) on November 2nd and asked to make an appointment with my doctor. The receptionist said, &ldquo;Hmm&hellip; the earliest we have available is on New Year&rsquo;s Eve? Could you come in then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clearly this presents a problem, because I need to take these meds EVERY DAY or I will develop resistance to them and have to change regimens, which could lead to (even more) highly unpleasant side-effects.</p>
<p>I believe that Big Trans Health Clinic, Inc, while being a great resource for many people (including a <em>certain kind</em> of queer &ndash; I will go into that more later) has overextended itself. It is over capacity; it has taken on too many clients and cannot care for the volume of patients that depend on them for ALL their health needs.</p>
<p>BUT THIS STORY DOES NOT HAVE AN UNHAPPY ENDING. I found a great alternative health care center which I am very excited about, and will tell you all about in a future post.</p>
