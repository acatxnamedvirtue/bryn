<h2>I feel like it's dumb to fault a FAAB person with not connecting with you on the level that a MAAB person did. Like, of course someone who has way more in common with you is going to connect with you more. I'm willing to bet FAAB people wouldn't connect to her as much. And sorry, but putting hair removal on the same level of importance of finding a supportive doula? Really? Good lord.</h2>
<p>When I first started this blog, I was, like, <em>does the world really need another transmisogyny complaining blog? Does everybody need to know my business? Why should I be writing about health care, I am no expert! Writing about my visits to the doctor will be so boring.</em></p>
<p>BUT THEN I GET AN ASK LIKE THIS AND I REALIZE THAT, YES, IT IS TIME TO GO TO SCHOOL. </p>
<p>First off, I reject “FAAB/MAAB” language. I understand it is helpful for some people to understand their bodies/experiences in certain ways, but it is just something I would prefer not to use in my own writing. (For the uninitiated, these terms stand for “female-assigned at birth” and “male-assigned at birth” and are used by trans people to talk about their bodies/lives/experiences. I know this news is old hat to some people, but I think it’s important bc I realize a lot of people are finding my blog through the #hiv tag and might not have the background in trans lingo.)</p>
<p>Moreover, the FAAB/MAAB distinction here totally misses the point of what I was trying to say. At the risk of <a href="http://partybottom.tumblr.com/post/69912399178/a-tale-of-two-trans-care-program-case-managers">repeating myself</a> (and I <em>hate</em> repeating myself), what I was trying to get at is that hiring practices in public health privilege fancy education over life experience, and that is a really big problem. </p>
<p>(Also, like I said, it’s not really about a matter of “connection.” I was/am friends with the “FAAB” case worker i was talking about in <a href="http://partybottom.tumblr.com/post/69912399178/a-tale-of-two-trans-care-program-case-managers">that post</a>. We have known each other for years and years and I feel I could tell her anything. I am actually a little afraid she will stumble on that post and her feelings will be hurt. A big part of the problems she experienced in that job were a matter of normal healthcare nonprofit overwork/underpay/too much need for care/not enough resources. But the fact stands that my new case manager is just better at helping me find the resources I need, and I think that has a lot to do with the fact that she has a lot of personal life experience with the communities she serves.)</p>
<p>Here’s the thing about social work/case management: it’s all relationships, knowing where the goodies are hidden, and people owing each other favors. Kids who move to the city fresh out of college and do not have intimate experiences with (and perhaps more importantly do not <em>come from</em>) the communities they are trying to work with are just, generally speaking, less effective at their jobs because they don’t have the right connections to make things work out. These kinds of professional networks take <em>years</em> to establish. Especially in this city (New York) with its labyrinthine social service network. </p>
<p>And as for your last comment about the value of doulas-versus-hair removal for trans women: Jesus Christ, I don’t even know where to start with that. You may think that dealing with facial hair/electrolysis is like some superfluous cosmetic thing, but it is such a deeply felt self-esteem problem for so many trans women, not to mention one of the main factors of passing/not passing on the street, getting harassed, being a victim of violence, and generally being afraid to leave your fucking house. I don’t know how to express to you how deeply mistaken you are with your dismissiveness on this issue. </p>
