<h2>Tell us more about yourself? What is your age, where you grew up, favorite color, sweet thing?</h2>
<p>partybottom now struggles with two conflicting impulses: <em>loving </em>to talk about herself, and not wanting to blow up her spot too much, because HIV stigma is still very, very real. but here are a few things:<br/><br/></p>
<ul><li>i am in my early thirties. (tw: boring queer/trans cred story ahead): i came out as gay when i was 13, started going to gay bars/hanging out with drag queens/dressing up in drag when i was 16, and started on hormones around the age of 20. in fact, i just passed my 11 year anniversary of HRT. whoo hoo?<br/><br/></li>
<li>i grew up in the US, mostly in the south and some in the midwest — all over appalachia, basically. my dad was a construction worker and he moved around a lot. my mom was a public school teacher so she did not. they were divorced. we were working class, but not poor. like, think the <em>roseanne</em> show before she got transphobic. i am white. <br/><br/></li>
<li>I started hanging out in/coming to New York about twelve years ago, and moved here full time six years ago. i primarily consider myself an artist/writer. i am on welfare.(welfare is something i really need to talk about on this blog).and have a couple of side hustles to make a little extra money. i have done sex work in the past (cam and escorting), but i do no longer. i am not anti-sex work; it’s just not for me, and i try to do anything i can to avoid having to do it. <br/><br/></li>
<li>i have volunteered at the <a href="http://www.srlp.org">sylvia rivera law project</a> for the past six years, and am currently part of their <a href="http://www.change.org/petitions/ny-governor-andrew-m-cuomo-and-nys-health-department-commissioner-dr-nirav-shah-stop-excluding-trans-and-gender-non-conforming-people-from-receiving-safe-and-affordable-healthcare">trans medicaid access campaign</a>. i also try to support events that raise money for other racial/social justice/hiv/harm reduction orgs like: the audre lorde project, FIERCE, (the now defunct) queers for economic justice, VOCAL: the new york user’s union, and the nyc harm reduction coalition, etc. /boring activist resume.<br/><br/></li>
<li>my favorite color is purple! specifically, <a href="http://www.theskinnystiletto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/laura-carmichael-1-michelle-dockery-5-jessica-brown-findlay-1.jpg">dusty lady mary crawley purples</a>. my friend today told me that i have “good branding and a strong visual language that i may not recognize” because i have basically been using this same color scheme since my livejournal in 2003;</li>
</ul><p>BONUS FUN FACT:<br/>my icon is of the character empress nympho from the movie <em>history of the world: part i. </em>i am eh blah about mel brooks but I think madeline khan is a comedic genius. specifically in this scene:<br/><br/><br/></p>
