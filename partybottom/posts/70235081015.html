<h2>MY DOCTOR SAID SOMETHING FUNNY THE OTHER DAY.</h2>
<p>as i mentioned in <a href="http://partybottom.tumblr.com/post/69999550361/awesome-visit-to-the-doctor-bonus-breast-exam-411">this post</a>, during my annual physical, i had a prostate exam. while i was bent over the table and my doctor had his finger up my ass (a sensation to which partybottom is certainly no stranger), he noticed a band-aid on my butt. </p>
<p>he said, <em>it looks like </em><em>somebody gave you a shot. who gave you a shot?</em> and I said, oh, my boyfriend gave me my hormone shot the other day. and i added, fun fact: he&rsquo;s transgender, too. </p>
<p>toward the end of the appointment, he was like, <em>okay, so, now, i&rsquo;m really sorry, but i&rsquo;m going to have to ask you a bunch of annoying questions. </em>and i was like, sure, ask away doctor! i will tell you anything you want to know, since you seem like a nice guy. (i was in a good mood.)</p>
<p>i realized very quickly that this was the &ldquo;harm reduction counseling&rdquo; part of the appointment. this kind of thing is mandated by the state &ndash; they have to do it to get funding, and i suppose it probably is a decent part of good health care, too. basically, he was asking a bunch of questions about substance use, med adherence (how often i take my meds and if i take them on time), and safer sex. </p>
<p>when we got to the sex questions, he starts out, <em>have you had sex since i saw you last? </em>and i enthusiastically answered, yes! then he was all, <em>do you have a partner? </em>and i was was like, yup. and then he was like, <em>are you monogamous? </em>and i was like, eh, yeah, more or less. and then he was like, <em>do you guys use condoms?</em> and i was like uuh, um, i mean, not really, i mean we don&rsquo;t really need to because we don&rsquo;t really have high-risk sex, i mean, the thing is, it&rsquo;s like&hellip;</p>
<p>and he goes,</p>
<p><em>OOOooh i remember, you said your boyfriend is transgender! so, he uses a strap-on or something? </em>and i was like YES, EXACTLY, TRUE, THAT IS EXACTLY HOW WE HAVE SEX.(actually, he uses a <a href="http://www.babeland.com/tantus-realdoe/d/1342">realdoe</a>, but no need to split hairs here.) and then my doctor was like, <em>psssh, you should have just said. this is APICHA, we hear everything. no judgement! what, you think i believe in abstinence or something? what, do i look like nancy reagan? </em></p>
<p>which is funny, because dr. tang does not look like nancy reagan. like, not even a little bit. </p>
<p>i guess you had to be there. </p>
