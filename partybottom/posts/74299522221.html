<h2>PARTY BOTTOM GETS VERY INTELLIGENT ASKS</h2>

<p><i>As a social work student and person with a certificate in social work, I completely agree with your comments about the ineffectiveness of social workers right out of university into a new community. You&rsquo;ve got to know your community to be a good social worker, and a lot of people just don&rsquo;t realize that. </i></p>

<p><i>Even more so, they attach themselves to some idea that everything they need to know they learned at school. I think what horrifies me the most about social workers is that you don&rsquo;t have to have training in anti-oppression or privilege or any of that. You can get by with one or two classes specifically addressing that. And more so, I find that in social work programs, queer folks are kind of held to this huge &ldquo;YOU KNOW EVERYHTING ABOUT ALL QUEERS&rdquo; idea, so few white, female-assigned, non-binary, middle class queers actually address the fact that they don&rsquo;t know what the issues affecting all queer people are. /end rant </i></p>

<p><i>I really appreciate your story (as a white &ldquo;FAAB&rdquo; genderqueer) because it helps me reconsider how I can be an ally with trans women and not reconstruct transmisogynistic power imbalances when having them as clients. Thank you!</i></p>

<p>This is an important point. Back when PartyBottom was a teenager and nascent social work student, her second required class was called something like, &ldquo;Working With Diverse Populations&rdquo; or whatnot, like, an introduction to cultural competency, which, while taught in some seriously questionable ways, at least introduced a class of mostly-white state school doofy 19-year olds to concepts like, &ldquo;sooo, reverse racism does not exist,&rdquo; which, I have to say, was a BRAIN ESPLODE moment for about half the class. </p>

<p>(However, I still use skills and knowledge I attained in that class, especially the unit on gerontology, which has been both helpful in my volunteer work at SAGE &ndash; an org called Services and Advocacy for Gay Elders, here in New York &ndash; as well as being a good friend/family member to people who are dealing with the difficulties that come with having an aging family member who is having trouble: hoarding, sundowning, dementia, anxiety about routine and attachment to sense of place, etc.) </p>

<p>I currently have a friend who is in an NYU MSW program and she on the regular hears the shittiest things come out of people&rsquo;s mouths, but that is perhaps not <i>not</i> tied to the fact that NYU is an incredibly expensive private school and most of the students there are hoping to hop on to a pipeline that will eventually lead to very lucrative private practice dealing with yuppie neurosis. </p>

<p>Also I would like to agree with and echo your comments about tokenization and its more sinister ill effects: when you are called on to be the spokesperson for &ldquo;the community,&rdquo; it is important to realize that you are a select representative of many communities, many of which share only the loosest of ties. Say, even if we&rsquo;re talking about &ldquo;the trans community in New York,&rdquo; this is a misnomer, as there are dozens of trans communities in New York, broken down by age, income, education, specific gender affinity, location/borough &ndash; and, perhaps most importantly, language and race. It bugs PartyBottom when people try to individually speak for all these constituencies, and it is something I hope to be wary of as I continue this blog. </p>

<p>Thanks for writing! xoxo PB</p>
