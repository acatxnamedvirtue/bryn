<h2>A KIND OF STUPID EXPERIENCE I HAD WITH A THERAPIST A LONG TIME AGO (and also a nice one i had, too)</h2>
<p>in <a href="http://partybottom.tumblr.com/post/70232746631/medicaid-mental-health-bureaucracy-sooooo-boring">this post</a> i said i have had a couple of really bad experiences with mental health practitioners. i would like to talk about some of them. this first one is not <em>très tragique</em> or anything, but i do think it impacted the course of my life in some significant way.</p>
<p>less than a year after i came out as trans, the apartment where i was living burned down. i was on technically-illegal hormones at the time, with no medical supervision. (where i was living at the time, it was very difficult and super $$$$$ to go the legal route.) i figured out my name change stuff by filling out legal forms i found on the internet. because my house had burned down, i was like, well, shit. i don&rsquo;t want to have to buy all boy clothes that i will just have to throw/give away after a while, so i might as well just go ahead and &ldquo;go full time&rdquo; (ugh, the early 2000s.) i was, at the time, enrolled at an enormous public state college, studying social work. </p>
<p>i was stressed out, to say the least. i had a lot of normal problems that 22 year-old college girls have: body image issues, self-esteem problems, boys, blah. i went to the college mental health clinic to make an appointment with a therapist. </p>
<p>i told her basically ^^^ (minus illegal hormones part) and this is what she said to me:</p>
<p><em>i don&rsquo;t feel competent to treat you because i have never met a transgender person before. it would be like if someone came in requesting a letter of psychiatric recommendation for gastric bypass surgery, and i had never met a fat person before. i&rsquo;m sorry, but i can&rsquo;t help you. </em></p>
<p>i tried to explain to her that i was not looking for her to sign off on any letters &ndash; there was <em>no way </em>(i thought at the time) i would be able to afford any surgery at any time in the then-near future. i just wanted to talk about being depressed and anxious. </p>
<p>still, she refused to treat me. </p>
<p>eventually, the anxiety and stuff got so bad that i stopped going to classes and dropped out of school and got a job (which paid $7/hour.) to this day, i have never finished college. </p>
<p>i am not <em>blaming</em> this counseling lady for my dropping out. but it&rsquo;s like, when trans people reach out for help &ndash; help that they really need &ndash; and are smacked down, there can be serious consequences, that range from mild set-backs to the heart-breakingly tragic. i mean i guess in a way it&rsquo;s good that she admitted her incompetence? but in a way i wish she had not just dismissed me, especially after i had admitted all the deeply personal things that i had admitted to her during a psych intake (anyone who has ever been through one of these will know what I mean.)</p>
<p>BUT BECAUSE PARTYBOTTOM IS ALL ABOUT POSITIVITY, i will end on a nice note. unexpectedly, it wasn&rsquo;t until i was diagnosed a few years later that i found a really good therapist who i was able to see through an ASO (AIDS service organization &ndash; like a nonprofit that provides services to HIV+ people.) here&rsquo;s the weird thing: i was 25 at the time, and she was 23. she had just graduated from the very same program that i had dropped out of. </p>
<p>can i repeat, she was <em>twenty-three years old</em>? i remember, on our first visit, she leaned over to throw something away in the trash and she had, like, a full on tramp stamp on her lower back! i was was like, oh lord jesus. </p>
<p>but you know, even though she didn&rsquo;t have that many trans clients and didn&rsquo;t know a whole lot about trans stuff, she was just open-minded enough to be caring and warm. it was a very fruitful therapeutic relationship that lasted for three years. she helped give me the courage to publish my writing for the first time, and eventually to move to new york. </p>
<p>(i know i have complained about bright-eyed baby social workers before, but i will make a distinction here: her job was not to be my <em>case manager</em><em>, </em>ie, someone who helps you navigate all the conflicting systems that control your life when you are living in poverty with a chronic illness, it was to be my therapist: to listen to my problems and feelings, to offer empathy and insight, and to help with the acquisition of the right set of emotional coping skills, whatever that looks like.)</p>
<p>in fact, us both being so young and so close in age really worked out well in some ways. i could be all like, <em>okay, this will sound ridiculous, but kimora lee simmons said this thing on the style network the other day that really resonated with me, </em>and she would be like <em>actually, i saw that episode of LIFE IN THE FAB LANE and i know exactly what you mean by that.</em></p>
<p>and she really did, is the thing. sometimes i think that&rsquo;s all it takes.  </p>
