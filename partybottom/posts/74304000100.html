<h2>divinity school tho???? not social work or gender studies???? or anything remotely???? linked????</h2>
<p>I guess this is a reference to <a href="http://partybottom.tumblr.com/post/69912399178/a-tale-of-two-trans-care-program-case-managers">this post</a> in which I seem to diss on a case manager who had an academic background in religious studies. (I still feel kind of bad about that.)</p>
<p>I want to make it abundantly clear that it&rsquo;s true that there are many divinity schools in which someone can receive extensive training in anti-oppression work, especially on a pastoral counseling level, and which emphasize the role of faith institutions in social justice movements, as well as <a href="http://partybottom.tumblr.com/post/74064562452/the-radical-gospel-of-martin-luther-king-al-jazeera">liberation theology</a>. And thus it is entirely possible to come out of theology school with a better (theoretical, anyway) social justice framework than coming out of a school of social/human services, as my <a href="http://partybottom.tumblr.com/post/74299522221/party-bottom-gets-very-intelligent-asks">last ask</a> just indicated. </p>
<p>What they don&rsquo;t teach you in theology school, though, is, like, <em>how to rush someone&rsquo;s Medicaid application approval before they get so sick they slip into a coma</em>* (womp womp.) So, I guess there are trade-offs. </p>
<p>*PS: This is an actual case that PartyBottom was actually apprised of when she was trying to get Medicaid as an unmarried/no kids individual in a stingy Ebenezer Scrooge Red State that was like, no social services for you, AIDS monster. However, this may have all changed since the the Affordable Care Act, so who fucking knows these days. </p>
