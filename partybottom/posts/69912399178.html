<h2>A TALE OF TWO TRANS CARE PROGRAM CASE MANAGERS</h2>
<p>As I mentioned in my last post, I have been receiving all my health care from Big Gay Health, Inc., NYC (many of you know where I am talking about) for the last six years.</p>
<p>During the time I was there, they hired a case manager specifically to work with trans clients. <em>Here&rsquo;s the thing</em>: I have known this person for several (12+?) years and am really not trying to shade them. I believe their heart is in the right place, but there are some institutional problems that lead to trans women getting bad care at places like this.</p>
<p>The trans care coordinator they hired at Big Gay Health, Inc was a white, female-assigned (FAAB, I believe, as the kids say these days) genderqueer  with an advanced degree in divinity studies from an Ivy League university. They were friendly. They were overworked. They had had several social-work type jobs before, but never (AFAIK) stayed with the same organization for more than two or three years. (Turnover in social services is a BIG PROBLEM for people who depend on these services, but that is a blog post for another time.) (They have since left this position to go to div school. Again. This time, for a different religion.)</p>
<p>As part of their job, a few years ago it was this coordinator&rsquo;s job to compile and release a &ldquo;comprehensive&rdquo; guide to trans health and wellness resources in the New York area. It was downloadable as a .pdf, so I perused it. I noticed that though it contained no resources for electrolysis, laser providers, or hair removal specialists of any kind, it listed no less than <em>six</em> birth doulas. I sent a FB message to the coordinator (again, we were/are friends) to say &ldquo;Hey, um&hellip; did you notice..?&rdquo; and the answer I got back was like, herp derp, we&rsquo;re still searching, it&rsquo;s a work in progress, non-pology.</p>
<p>(The resource guide has since been updated to include hair removal, but IDK anything about the practitioners in it.)</p>
<p><em><strong>IN</strong><strong> CONTRAST</strong></em>, I recently switched health care providers to a smaller clinic whose main populations are men of color who have sex with men, HIV+ people, lesbians (LOTS of studs &amp; AGs in the waiting room always), sex workers, undocumented patients, and trans people. I was able to get an appointment there very quickly.</p>
<p>The intake was nbd, but one of the best parts was getting to meet the trans care coordinator there. She is a bilingual Argentine immigrant trans woman (I learned this from her bio on a workshop flyer). She is so smart and friendly and awesome. Here is what she said to me:<br/><br/><em>Girl! You look good! And it looks like you got your name changed, your ID changed, your Medicaid straight, your hormones. </em>(She looks at my chart) <em>Oh and it looks like you got the orchiectomy too! That must be why you look so soft. I&rsquo;ve been thinking about doing that too. So, what do you need from me?</em></p>
<p>I told her, well, sometimes I&rsquo;m a little self-conscious about the facial hair I have left. Do you know any good electrologists? She said,</p>
<p><em>You know I get a little bit of this-this </em>(points to her face) <em>sometimes, too. Did you know there&rsquo;s an electrology school way out in Queens? The girls that work there have had like 700 hours of training, they just need to get their last 300 clinical hours so they need people to work on. It&rsquo;s free, or maybe $20 an hour or something like that. Hey, here&rsquo;s my personal email - email me sometime and we&rsquo;ll go together and make a day of it. </em></p>
<p>I was fucking <em>agog. </em>I have never had a provider be so sweet, kind, and real with me &ndash; not to mention giving me such USEFUL INFORMATION. (Speaking of which, I will be posting about that referral shortly.)</p>
<p>Point is, I think it all comes down to hiring practices. If you prioritize education and being able to speak a certain kind of social-work-y, tenderqueer vernacular, you will get providers who can provide services for white, FAAB, transmasculine people. If you prioritize hiring people from the communities you hope to serve &ndash; people who have <em>lived the life</em> &ndash; you will serve those communities, and, hopefully, serve them well. <br/><br/>(<em>Nota bene</em>: I did not invent these ideas, I just happen to be living them. Activist and artist Mirha Soleil-Ross has been talking about this kind of thing for years, and academic Viviane Namaste lays down the extended remix in her book <em>Invisible Lives</em>. Canadians, I tell you what.)<br/><br/>tl;dr: best trans care social worker story ever.</p>
