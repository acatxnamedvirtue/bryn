<h2>Hi! Im a somewhat closeted trans girl id love to know about the clinic you mentioned in your last post where your advisor was a trans woman. Where is this wonderful place and do any of these places take people without insurance? Love your blog. You're wonderful. Thank you.</h2>
<p>partybottom is about to NAME NAMES:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.apicha.org/">http://www.apicha.org/</a></p>
<p>they’re not kidding around: it is easy and fast to get an appointment there. i called and said, “i’m a new patient, when can i schedule an intake?” and the receptionist (who is SUPER NICE) said, “well, how’s tomorrow at 11am?”  <br/><br/>i’m sure they have many of the same problems as many nonprofits/community health clinics, but i have gotten very good care there, which is something i plan on writing about more in the future. </p>
<p>they *do* take uninsured patients, and they *do* take undocumented patients. in fact one of the only “problems” (and it’s not really a problem, for me anyway) that i ran into was that i cannot access mental health services there, since they save most of the slots in the mental health program for undocumented patients, which, hey, is fine with me, because i am lucky enough to have public insurance (Medicaid.) besides, a social worker spent an hour with me the other day calling around to find a good trans-friendly mental health clinic that will take my insurance, so i am feeling hopeful about it. if you are looking for mental health help, and for whatever reason do not qualify for mental/behavioral health services there, i bet they would help you find a good free/sliding scale mental health clinic, too.  (though keep in mind, i am not an expert or a social worker, just a patient with a blog.) :D</p>
<p>fun fact: APICHA gets really good reviews on Yelp. My doctor actually mentioned this to me: <em>I mean I’m not complaining that people like us but I think it’s so weird! It’s not like we’re a restaurant or something! </em>He’s a funny guy. <br/><br/>Anyway, best of luck to you! I hope it works out for you and you get good care. You deserve it. &lt;3 &lt;3</p>
